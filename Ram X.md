[[Abilities]], [[Attack]], [[Dice]], [[Movement]], [[Speed]]

While a unit with the ram x keyword performs an attack,  
during the “Modify Attack Dice” step, it may change x attack  
die results to critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results if it performed at least 1  
full standard move at its maximum speed during the same  
activation as this attack.  

• Blank results and hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results can be changed to critical  
(![[CritIcon.png]]) results using the ram x keyword  

• In order to use the ram x keyword, a unit must have  
performed a full standard move before performing the  
attack, and both the move and the attack must be performed  
during the same activation.  

• A unit may use the ram x keyword even if it performed a  
different action between performing a full standard move  
and performing an attack, as long as the relevant move and  
attack are performed during the same activation.

• A full standard move is a move using the full length of the  
movement tool, placing the unit leader at the very end of the  
tool when completing the move.  

• A unit whose maximum speed has been reduced is still  
considered to have performed a move at its maximum speed  
as long as the move was performed using the highest speed  
movement tool available to that unit.
