A graffiti token represents a striking  
image or symbol painted onto the  
terrain of the battlefield. Graffiti  
tokens affect a unit’s morale.  

• During the “Rally” step of a unit’s  
activation:  
» If it has line of sight to a friendly graffiti token at range  
1–2, it may roll 1 additional die.  
» If it has line of sight to an enemy graffiti token at range  
1–2, it must roll 1 fewer die, to a minimum of 1.  

• Graffiti tokens remain in play until the end of the game.  

• Graffiti tokens must be placed flat, either on the battlefield  
or on a piece of terrain.

• Units can move through and end their movement on  
graffiti tokens.  

• Graffiti tokens have two sides. When placing a graffiti token,  
the red player should place the token with the red side faceup,  
while the blue player should the token with the blue side faceup.  

• If a unit has line of sight to and is at range 1–2 of both a  
friendly graffiti token and an enemy graffiti token, the effects  
of both tokens are canceled.
