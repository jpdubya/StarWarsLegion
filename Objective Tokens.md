Many objective cards instruct players  
to place objective tokens on the  
battlefield. Players can claim objective  
tokens to earn victory points.  
• Miniatures can move through but  
cannot overlap objective tokens.  
• Objective tokens cannot be placed overlapping other  
objective tokens.  
• When placing objective tokens on the battlefield, objective  
tokens cannot be placed underneath pieces of terrain.  
• Each objective token has two sides, a claimed side and an  
unclaimed side.  
• Some objective cards specify that objective tokens can be  
claimed by units via the **[[claim]]** action.
» Only a unit leader can claim an objective token. To claim  
an objective token, a unit’s leader must be in base contact  
with the objective token.  
» When a player's unit leader claims an objective token,  
that player flips the objective token from its unclaimed  
side to the claimed side and places it back onto the  
battlefield in the ==same== position and in base contact with  
the unit leader. The token will remain in base contact  
with the unit leader as it moves around the battlefield,  
unless the unit leader becomes panicked or is defeated.  
» After a player's unit leader with a claimed objective  
token performs a move, that player picks up the claimed  
objective token and places it ==anywhere== in base contact  
with the unit leader.
• If the objective card states that a claimed objective token  
is placed in base contact with a unit during setup, that  
objective token is considered to be claimed by that unit.  
» If a player’s unit leader with a claimed objective token  
becomes panicked or is defeated, before they remove  
or move the unit leader, that player flips the objective  
token to its unclaimed side and places it back onto the  
battlefield in the ==same== position and in base contact  
with the unit leader. The objective token remains on the  
battlefield where it was placed and can be claimed again  
as normal.
» An objective token that has been claimed by a unit  
leader cannot leave the battlefield or be place fully or  
partially outside of the battlefield at any point.  
• If the objective card does not specify that objective tokens  
can be claimed, tokens cannot be claimed this game. Instead,  
these tokens are used to mark areas or serve other purposes,  
as described by the objective card.  
• Some objective cards specify that claimed objective tokens  
can be dropped by units via the ==drop== free action.  
» When a player's unit leader drops a claimed objective  
token, that player flips the objective token to its  
unclaimed side and places it back onto the battlefield  
in the ==same== position and in base contact with the unit  
leader  
» After an objective token is dropped by a unit, it is no  
longer considered to be claimed by that unit.
• Some objective cards specify that objective tokens can be  
interacted with via the **[[sabotage or repair]]** action.  
» Only a unit leader in base contact with an objective  
token can use the **[[sabotage or repair]]** keyword.  
» Wound tokens are only placed on objective tokens  
through the **[[sabotage or repair]]** keyword. Objective  
tokens cannot suffer wounds from attacks or from any  
game effect other than the **[[sabotage or repair]]** keyword.  
» Objective tokens cannot have fewer than 0  
wound tokens.
