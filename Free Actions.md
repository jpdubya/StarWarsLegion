Through the use of free actions, a unit can perform more than  
two actions during its activation.  

• A unit cannot perform the same action more than once  
during its activation, except the move action, which can be  
performed multiple times.  

• If an effect provides a unit with a free action of a certain  
type, such as a free attack action, performing that free action  
does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation,  
but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects  
and therefore does not allow a unit to perform a non-move  
action more than once during its activation.

_For example, Darth Vader performs a move action, triggering  
his **[[relentless]]** ability and allowing him to perform a free  
attack action. After this free attack action, Darth Vader still  
has one of his two actions remaining, but he cannot use this  
remaining action to perform another attack action._

• If an effect provides a unit with a free action without  
specifying a type of action, that unit may perform any action  
that it could normally perform. Performing that free action  
does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation,  
but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects  
and therefore does not allow a unit to perform a non-move  
action more than once during its activation.  

• A trooper unit that loses an action because it is suppressed  
can still perform any number of free actions.  

• A vehicle unit that loses an action because it is damaged can  
still perform any number of free actions.  

• Free actions can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby  
tokens. If an effect specifically instructs a unit to gain an  
aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is different than  
performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore  
does not trigger abilities or effects that occur after aim,
dodge, or standby actions are performed.
