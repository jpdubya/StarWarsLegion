[[Light Transport X Open or Closed]] (Unit  
Keyword), [[Movement]], [[Transport X Open or Closed]] (Unit  
Keyword), [[Transported]]

Embarking and disembarking are types of moves that allow a  
unit to enter or exit a vehicle with the **[[transport x]]** or **[[Light Transport X]]** keyword.  

To embark into a transport with the **[[transport x open]]**  
keyword, a unit uses 1 action to perform a speed-1 move that  
puts its unit leader into base contact with a friendly vehicle that  
can transport that type of unit.  

To embark into a transport with the **[[transport x closed]]**  
keyword, a unit spends its entire activation to perform a  
speed-1 move that puts its unit leader into base contact with a  
friendly vehicle that can transport that type of unit.  

Then, the unit is removed from the battlefield and a pair of ID  
tokens are placed, one near the base of the vehicle and one next  
to the unit, to indicate that the unit is being transported by that  
vehicle, and its activation ends.  

To disembark, a unit that is being transported uses 1 action to  
place its unit leader in base contact with the vehicle and then  
performs a speed–1 move with the unit.

• When a unit embarks, any tokens that unit has are  
moved off the battlefield with the unit. That unit still has  
those tokens.  

• When a unit disembarks, any tokens that were moved off  
the battlefield with the unit are placed back on the battlefield  
next to the unit. That unit still has those tokens.

• When a unit disembarks, if the vehicle that is transporting  
that unit has performed more than one standard move or  
reverse during the current round, disembarking uses that  
unit’s entire activation and it cannot perform additional  
actions or any free actions.  

• A unit that is disembarking cannot be placed into base  
contact with any enemy units.  
» A unit leader cannot be placed into base contact with an  
enemy unit when beginning a disembark move.  
» While performing the speed–1 move, a unit cannot  
move into base contact with an enemy unit.  

• Any abilities that trigger after a unit performs a move trigger
after a unit embarks or disembarks, if able.

• Any abilities that trigger after a unit performs a move action  
trigger after a unit performs a move action to embark or  
disembark, if able.  

• A unit cannot both embark and disembark during the same  
activation.  

• Units that have a maximum speed of 0 cannot embark or  
disembark.  

• Units that have the **[[stationary]]** keyword cannot embark or  
disembark.  

• A unit with a claimed objective token cannot embark or  
disembark.  

• Embarking and disembarking are not standard moves. 

• If a game effect allows or forces a unit to perform a speed–x  
move, it cannot use that move to embark or disembark.  

• A unit that is being transported can use its standby token  
to disembark.
