[[Attack]], [[Cover]], [[Cover X]]

During the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of an attack, a unit  
with the sharpshooter x keyword subtracts x from the  
defender’s cover.  
• When determining cover, add cover values (not exceeding  
heavy cover), before subtracting cover values.

_For example, a unit with heavy cover and a suppression  
token that is attacked by a unit with sharpshooter 1 has  
light cover._
