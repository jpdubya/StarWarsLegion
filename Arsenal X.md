 [[Attack]], [[Attack Pool]], [[Weapons]]

When choosing weapons during the “[[Form Attack Pool]]” step of  
an attack, each mini in a unit that has the **arsenal x** keyword  
can choose a number of its weapons equal to the value of x.  
Each chosen weapon contributes its dice and keywords to the  
attack pool.  

• To use a weapon during an attack, the defender must be at  
or within any of the weapon’s ranges.

• A mini that has the **arsenal x** keyword can divide its  
weapons between any number of units, forming a separate  
dice pool for each weapon or combination of weapons.  
	» A unit that has the **arsenal x** keyword is not required  
to add weapons with the same name to the same attack  
pool; it can add weapons with the same name to separate  
attack pools.
