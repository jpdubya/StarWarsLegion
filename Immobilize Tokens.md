A unit’s maximum speed is reduced by 1 for  
each immobilize token it has. A unit whose  
maximum speed is 0 and has at least one  
immobilize token cannot perform moves of  
any kind. At the end of a unit’s activation, it  
removes any immobilize tokens that it has.  

• A unit with 1 or more immobilize tokens  
can still perform "speed–x" moves or have "speed–x" moves  
performed with it through effects that occur outside of its
activation, even if its maximum speed is 0.

• When a unit performs a move, apply any effects that  
increase the unit’s maximum speed (up to speed 3), before  
applying any effects that reduce that unit’s maximum speed.
