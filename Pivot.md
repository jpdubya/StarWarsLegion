[[Movement]], [[Notch]], [[Unit Leader]]

A pivot is a type of movement that allows a mini with a notched  
base to change the orientation of its base.  
• When a mini pivots, that mini can rotate its base up to 900  
in either direction.  
• To pivot, a player rotates the unit leader’s base around the  
base’s center point. The center point of the unit leader’s base  
should remain in place throughout the pivot.  
• If a notched-base unit contains multiple miniatures, each  
mini in the unit must pivot so the orientation of its base  
matches the orientation of the unit leader’s base.  
• A unit can pivot while in difficult terrain without suffering  
any penalties.  
• If a game effect triggers by a unit moving, that game effect  
triggers by pivoting.
• When a mini with a non-round base pivots, it cannot  
overlap other mini’s bases, unless it is able to displace  
those minis.
• When a ground vehicle pivots, if it has a non-round base, it  
displaces friendly and enemy trooper minis.
