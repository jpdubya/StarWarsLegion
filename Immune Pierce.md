[[Attack]], [[Pierce X]] (Weapon Keyword)

While a unit with the immune: pierce keyword is defending,  
the attacker cannot use the pierce x keyword to cancel  
block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results on defense dice rolled by the defender.

• While a unit with immune: pierce is using the **[[guardian X]]**  
keyword, the attacker cannot use **[[pierce x]]** to cancel  
block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results on defense dice rolled by that unit.  
» The attacker ==can== use pierce x on defense dice rolled  
by a unit without immune: pierce that is using the  
**[[Guardian X]]** keyword, even if the ==defender== has immune:  
pierce.
