[[Actions]], [[Card Actions]], [[Height]], 
[[Movement]], [[Additional Terrain Rules]]

A unit that has the jump x keyword can perform the jump x  
card action. To perform this action, the unit performs a move as  
normal. However, the unit can ignore or end its movement on  
top of terrain that is height x or lower.  

• When a unit performs the jump x card action, treat this  
action as a move action.  

• When a unit performs the jump x action, measure height  
from that unit’s starting position.  

_For example, Luke Skywalker uses the jump 1 keyword to  
perform a move. Luke Skywalker’s starting position is on top  
of height 1 terrain. He may end his move on height 2 terrain  
or lower._

• When a unit performs the jump x action, it may end its  
movement at any height lower than its starting position,  
regardless of the value of x.  

_For example, Luke Skywalker uses the jump 1 keyword to  
perform a move. Luke Skywalker’s starting position is on top  
of height 2 terrain. He may chose to end his move at a point  
on the battlefield that is lower than his starting position, even  
if the difference between his starting and final position is  
greater than height 1._

• While performing a move with the jump x action, a unit  
ignores the effects of difficult terrain.  

• The jump x ability also allows a unit to ignore other minis  
with a height equal to or lower than x while performing  
a move with the jump x action. When doing so, the unit  
cannot end its move overlapping the base of a another mini.

• The jump x ability can be used any time a unit would  
perform a move action or free move action, including while  
using the **[[dauntless]]** keyword or when a friendly unit uses  
the **[[pulling the strings]]** ability.  

• The jump x ability must be used while a panicked unit  
attempts to flee the battlefield if it will help the unit flee the  
battlefield by the most expeditious route.
