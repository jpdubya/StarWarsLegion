[[Abilities]], [[Attack]], [[Cohesion]]

The scatter keyword allows an attacking unit to send the  
defender into disarray. After a unit performs an attack using  
a weapon with the scatter keyword against a trooper unit  
whose minis are affixed to small bases, it may move any non-  
unit leader minis in the defending unit, following all the rules  
of cohesion, as if the defending unit leader had just performed a  
standard move.
