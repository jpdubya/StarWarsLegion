[[Aim]], [[Attack]], [[Dodge]]

Skilled practitioners of the fighting arts, units with the duelist  
keyword are able to improve their capabilities in melee combat.  

• While a unit with the duelist keyword performs a melee  
attack, if it spends 1 or more aim tokens during the [[Roll Attack Dice]] 
step, the attack pool gains the pierce 1 keyword.

• While a unit with the duelist keyword defends against  
a melee attack, if it spends at least 1 dodge token during  
the Apply Dodge and Cover step, it gains the immune:  
piece keyword.  

• The unit with the duelist keyword gains these effects  
in addition to the normal effects of spending aim and  
dodge tokens.
