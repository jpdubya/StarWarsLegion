[[Abilities]], [[Victory Tokens]]

While a battle rages on, some units have a hidden directive or  
a dire goal that will swing the tide of the larger conflict. Once  
per game, as a free card action, a unit with the secret mission  
keyword can place 1 victory token on their card if they are  
within an enemy deployment zone. At the end of the game, if  
that unit has at least 1 victory token, used the secret mission  
ability, and is not defeated, the player that controls that unit  
gains 1 victory token.  

• A player who controls a unit that has the secret mission  
keyword and has a victory token gains 1 victory token only  
if that unit has a victory token due to using the secret  
mission ability.  

• When playing a game that uses scenario battle cards, such  
as those found in the Downed AT-ST expansion, unless  
otherwise stated, the secret mission keyword cannot  
be used.

» Scenario battle cards have a scenario icon in the top  
right corner of the card.
