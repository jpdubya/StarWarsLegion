[[Abilities]], [[Attack]], [[Suppression]]

Some units appear inconsequential to the battle, and are often  
ignored by enemy forces. While a unit with the inconspicuous  
keyword has at least one suppression token, when an enemy  
unit performs an attack, it must target another unit, if able.

• When a unit with the inconspicuous keyword rallies, it  
may choose not to remove any suppression tokens.  
» That unit still removes 1 suppression token during the  
End Phase, as normal.
