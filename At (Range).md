At is a term used on cards and in the rulebook when  
describing range.  

• A unit is at a range if the portion of a miniature’s base that is  
closest to the object from which range is being measured is  
inside the segment that corresponds to that range.  

• If the base of the mini being measured to touches the  
raised line between two range ruler segments without  
crossing it, the mini is at the lower range segment that the  
line separates
