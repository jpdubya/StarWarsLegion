Depressions in the battlefield like blast holes, craters, and trenches  
can provide trooper minis with cover, but are unique in that they  
only provide cover to minis that are fully within that terrain.  
Generally, unless these depressions are very deep, they provide cover  
only to trooper minis and not to vehicle minis.  

When determining cover, if the attacker traces a line from their  
unit leader through a hole, crater, trench, or other depression, that  
depression is ignored when determining if a target mini is obscured.  
However, a trooper mini that is overlapping this type of terrain  
(positioned within a crater or inside a trench, for example) has cover,  
even if the terrain does not obscure half or more of the mini.

Finally, trooper minis moving inside a trench treat it as open terrain,  
but trooper minis that move into, out of, or across a trench treat it as  
difficult terrain.
