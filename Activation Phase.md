# Activation Phase
[[Actions]], [[Courage]], [[Free Actions]], [[Issuing Orders]], [[Order Pool]], [[Order Tokens]], [[Panic]], [[Priority]], [[Rank]]

During the Activation Phase, players take turns activating  
their units.  

• Starting with the player who has priority, each player takes  
a turn activating one of their unactivated units. Players  
continue alternating turns until each unit on the battlefield  
has activated.  
	» If one player has more units on the battlefield than  
	the other player, after the player who has fewer units  
	activates their last unit, the player who has more units  
	will take multiple consecutive turns until their last unit  
	has activated.  

• When it is a player’s turn to activate a unit, he or she  
performs the following steps:  

1. **Choose Unit**: The player either chooses a friendly unit with  
a faceup order token or draws a random order token from  
their order pool and chooses a friendly unit with a matching  
rank that does not have an order token.

2. **Activate Unit**: The player activates the chosen unit,  
performing up to two actions and any number of free  
actions with that unit. 

3. **Place Order Token**: The player places the unit’s order token  
facedown on the battlefield near the unit leader. 

• If a player draws a random order token from their order pool  
and that order token does not correspond to a unit that can  
be activated—usually because that unit was defeated and  
removed from the battlefield—the player removes the order  
token from the game and draws a different token from their  
order pool.  

• After all units have been activated, the Activation Phase ends  
and players proceed to the End Phase.
