[[Embark And Disembark]], [[Transported]],  
[[Transport X: Open/Closed]] (Unit Keyword)

The light transport x: open/closed keyword allows a  
vehicle to transport friendly trooper units that consist of a  
single mini, such as commanders and operatives. Eligible  
trooper units must consist of exactly 1 mini, and that mini must  
be on a small round base.  

Units with the light transport x: open/closed keyword  
otherwise follow all the same rules as units with the **[[transport  
x: open or closed]]** keyword, found on on page 76. For rules on  
being transported, see "Transported" on page 76. For rules on  
how units embark and disembark, see "Embark and Disembark"  
on page 42.  

â€¢ A vehicle with the light transport x keyword can  
transport a number of eligible units up to the value x.
