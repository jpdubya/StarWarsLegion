[[Actions]], [[Card Actions]], [[Objective Tokens]]

Some units operate on the fringes of a battlefield, observing  
enemies and gathering important intel. As a card action, a unit  
with the observe x keyword can choose an enemy unit at  
range 1â€“3 and in line of sight. The chosen enemy unit gains x  
observation tokens.
