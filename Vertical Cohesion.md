This unit is in cohesion because it fulfills the following  
three requirements:  
1. Measured horizontally, each mini is no farther away  
from the unit leader than the length of the speed-1  
movement tool.  
2. Each mini in the unit is within height 1 of each  
other mini.  
3. The unit climbed down this round, and each mini in  
the unit is placed such that the distance between it  
and its unit leader is a legal speed-1 or climb move.
