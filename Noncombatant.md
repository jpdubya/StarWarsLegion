[[Unit Leader]], [[Wounds]]

If an upgrade that adds a miniature to a unit has the  
noncombatant keyword, the mini added by that upgrade  
cannot use any weapons and wounds must be assigned to other  
non-unit leader minis first.  

• While a unit is defending, if a mini added by an upgrade  
with the noncombatant keyword is the only non-unit  
leader mini that the attacking unit has line of sight to, it  
must be assigned wounds even if there are still other non-
unit leader minis.  

• If a mini added by an upgrade with the noncombatant  
keyword already has one or more wound tokens, it  
must be assigned wounds before minis that do not have  
wound tokens.  

• If the unit leader mini in a unit with the noncombatant  
keyword is defeated, a noncombatant mini cannot be  
replaced by a new unit leader mini unless there are no other  
minis without the noncombatant keyword.
