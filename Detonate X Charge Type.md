[[Area Weapon]], [[Arm X Charge Token]] (Weapon  
Keyword), [[Attack]], [[Attack Pool]], [[Charge Tokens]], [[Detonate]], [[Weapons]]

After a unit controlled by any player attacks, moves, or performs  
an action, each unit that has a weapon with the detonate x:  
charge type keyword may detonate up to x friendly charge  
tokens of the specified type. See [[Detonate]].  

• Any unit keywords of the unit that detonates the charge  
token do not apply to any attacks made when the charge  
token detonates.  

• When a charge token detonates, the unit that detonates the  
token cannot spend aim tokens to reroll attack dice.  

• When a charge token detonates, the unit that detonates  
the token cannot add any other weapons to any of the
attack pools.

• When a charge token detonates, do not refer to the surge  
conversion chart of the unit that detonated the token. Each  
charge type has its own surge conversion chart on the same  
card as the attack profile associated with that charge type.  

• Charge and condition tokens cannot suffer wounds.  

• After a unit attacks, moves, or performs an action a charge  
token can be detonated before any other abilities or  
effects that occur after a unit performs an action; with the  
exception of spending a standby token which can be spent  
by a unit before the token detonates.  
» If an attack includes multiple attack pools, a unit cannot  
use the detonate x keyword until each attack pool has  
been fully resolved.  

• If, after a unit attacks, moves, or performs an action, both  
players have units with the detonate x: charge type  
keyword that could detonate charge tokens, the player that  
does not control the unit that just performed the attack,  
move, or action may use their unit’s detonate x: charge  
type keyword first.

• A unit can use the detonate x: charge type ability after  
a unit performs or spends an action in any way or uses  
its entire activation, including after a unit withdraws or  
performs a move while disabled.
