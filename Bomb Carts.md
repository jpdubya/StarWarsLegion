 [[Displacement]], [[Movement]], [[Objective Cards]]

The Payload objective card requires two bomb cart miniatures.  
A bomb cart mini consists of a repulsor pallet miniature affixed  
to a 50mm notched base with 1 to 2 bombs, or similarly sized  
minis, placed on top of the pallet. When playing a game with  
the Payload objective card, each player may supply their own  
bomb cart. Or, if one player has supplied both bomb carts, the  
other player should choose which of the two bomb carts is  
theirs to use for that game.  

Each piece of terrain chosen while resolving the Payload  
objective card must be touching the battlefield directly.

Each bomb cart mini has the following special rules:  

• A bomb cart mini is not a unit and cannot gain tokens,  
suffer wounds, or be targeted by any effects that target units.  

• A bomb cart mini provides heavy cover to non-creature  
troopers, and no cover to creature troopers or vehicles.  

• All units, friendly and enemy, can move through bomb cart  
minis, but cannot end their movement overlapping a bomb  
cart mini’s base.  

• A bomb cart mini can move through all units, friendly and  
enemy, but cannot end its movement overlapping the base of  
another mini that cannot be displaced.  

» A bomb cart mini can move through a group of friendly  
and enemy minis engaged in a melee, but cannot  
displace them.  

• A bomb cart mini’s final position can overlap a trooper  
mini’s base if that trooper mini can be displaced. Doing so  
displaces that trooper mini.  

• A bomb cart mini can move through another bomb cart  
mini, but cannot end its movement overlapping the other  
mini’s base.

• A bomb cart mini can perform partial moves.  

• A bomb cart mini ignores the effects of difficult terrain. 

• A bomb cart mini can move through or over impassible  
terrain, so long as its final placement is legal. A bomb cart  
mini is treated as a unit when determining legal placement.
