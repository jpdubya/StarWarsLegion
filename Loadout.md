[[Deployment]], [[Upgrade Cards]]

A unit with the loadout keyword is adaptable and prepared  
for multiple contingencies; they are able to customize their  
equipment and hone their skills before each mission. When a  
player includes a unit with the loadout keyword in their army,  
for each upgrade card equipped to that unit, they may choose  
another upgrade card of the same type with equal or lesser  
points cost and set it aside. When the unit with the loadout  
keyword deploys, it may swap any number of its equipped  
upgrade cards with the set-aside upgrade cards.  

• Equipped upgrade cards can be swapped only with set-  
aside upgrade cards of the same type and of equal or lesser  
points cost.  

• Each set-aside upgrade card must be able to be equipped by  
the unit with the loadout keyword.  

• When swapping upgrade cards, a unit cannot have two  
or more upgrades with the same name equipped at the  
same time.

• If two or more units with the loadout keyword are in  
the same army, keep their respective set-aside upgrade  
cards separate. Each unit can swap upgrade cards only  
with their own set-aside cards; they cannot share set-aside  
upgrade cards.  

• A counterpart card that is added to a unit with the loadout  
keyword also benefits from the loadout ability.
