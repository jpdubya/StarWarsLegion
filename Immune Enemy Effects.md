[[Hostage Cards]]

A unit with the immune: enemy effects keyword ignores all  
enemy card effects and cannot be targeted by any enemy card  
effects.  

• The unit is still subject to friendly card effects and battle  
card effects.  

• Enemy card effects include all effects from abilities,  
keywords, and text on unit cards, upgrade cards, and  
command cards controlled by an opponent.

• See "[[Card Effect]]" for additional rules
