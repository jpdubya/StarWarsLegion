[[Army building]], [[Command Cards]], [[Command Phase]],
[[Courage]], [[Issuing Orders]]

A unit with the field commander keyword is able to issue  
orders in a limited capacity. When a player reveals a non-  
commander or operative specific command card, they may  
nominate a friendly unit with the field commander keyword  
as a commander and issue orders with that unit.  

• A unit nominated as a commander using the field  
commander keyword is treated as a commander only for  
the purposes of issuing orders with a command card during  
that Command Phase.  

In addition to the field commander keyword’s normal effect,
while building an army, if you include a unit that has the  
field commander keyword, you may ignore the minimum  
commander unit requirement. If you do, when you deploy  
a unit with field commander, mark that unit with the  
commander token. That unit keeps its current rank; however,  
as per the rules of field commander, that unit may be  
nominated as a commander when a neutral command card is  
played. In addition, while that unit has a commander token,  
friendly units at range 1–3 may treat their courage value as 2  
when checking whether they panic. 

• If the unit with field commander and the commander  
token is defeated, a new commander must be nominated  
as normal.
