[[Command Cards]], [[Command Phase]],  
[[Commander]], [[Order Tokens]], [[Range]], [[Rank]]

During the Command Phase, when it is a player’s turn to  
resolve their revealed command card, they nominate one of  
their commanders on the battlefield. That commander issues  
orders to the number and type of units presented on the  
revealed command card.  

• A unit needs to fulfill the following criteria to be issued  
an order:  
» The unit must be of a type presented on the player’s  
revealed command card.  
» The unit must be at range 1–3 of the player’s  
nominated commander.  
» The unit cannot have already received an order during  
the current game round.

• When a unit is issued an order, a player places an order  
token that matches the faction and rank of the unit receiving  
the orders near that unit on the battlefield; the player places  
the order token so its rank is faceup.  

• When playing an operative’s command card, the player does  
not nominate a commander; instead they nominate the  
operative, and that operative issues orders.  

• If a player does not have a commander or operative on the  
battlefield, that player cannot play a command card during  
the Command Phase.  

• Orders are issued one at a time, in an order chosen by the  
player who controls the unit that is issuing the orders. Any  
game effects that triggers when or after an order is issued are  
resolved one at a time, when or after that order is issued, and  
before any other orders are issued.

• During the Command Phase, a unit can be issued an order  
only once, even if a game effect causes that order to be  
removed or issued to another unit instead.
