[[Defeated]], [[Wounds]]

Some abilities, such as the treat and repair keywords, or  
certain card effects allow a player to restore minis to friendly  
units. To restore a mini to a unit, that unit must have had one  
or more minis defeated that round. Choose a mini that was  
defeated during the current round and place that mini on the  
battlefield in cohesion with its unit leader. Then, give that mini  
a number of wound tokens equal to one less than the wound  
threshold indicated on its unit card.  

• If all of a unit’s minis have been defeated, then that unit is no  
longer in play, and thus cannot have its minis restored.  

• If cards in a player’s army have the ability to restore minis, it  
is recommended that the player track which of their minis  
have been defeated during the current round, in order to  
avoid confusion. For example, minis can be tipped on their  
side and temporarily left on the battlefield near their unit  
until the round ends, or marked in some way that is clear to  
both players.
