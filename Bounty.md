[[Defeated]], [[Poison Tokens]], [[Setup]], [[Victory Tokens]], [[Winning the Game]]

After setup, a unit with the **bounty** keyword chooses an enemy  
commander or enemy operative and marks that unit with a  
victory token. Place that token on the enemy unit's unit card.

After a unit with the **bounty** keyword defeats an enemy  
unit with a victory token (typically by performing an attack  
against that unit which causes it to be defeated), the victory  
token moves to the unit with **bounty**. Place that token on its  
unit card.  

At the end of the game, if a player controls a unit that has  
the **bounty** keyword and has at least 1 victory token due to  
defeating an enemy unit, and that unit has not been defeated  
itself, that player gains 1 victory token. A player gains 1  
victory token in this way for each unit they control that meets  
these requirements.  

• A victory token is only transfered from a defeated enemy  
unit to a unit with the bounty keyword if that victory token  
was placed on that enemy unit during setup due to the  
bounty keyword.  

» If a friendly unit with the bounty keyword defeats an  
enemy unit that has the bounty keyword and has a  
victory token due to defeating another unit, that token  
does not transfer from one unit to the other because it  
was not placed on that enemy unit during setup due to  
the bounty keyword.

» If a friendly unit with the bounty keyword defeats an  
enemy unit that has the secret mission keyword and  
has a victory token due to using the secret mission  
ability, that token does not transfer from one unit to  
the other because it was not placed on that enemy unit  
during setup due to the bounty keyword.  

• If a unit with the bounty keyword performs an attack and  
another unit with a victory token uses the **[[Guardian x]]**  
keyword and suffers wounds that cause it to be defeated, the  
victory token moves to the unit with bounty.  

• If a unit with the bounty keyword detonates a charge and  
that charge defeats an enemy unit with a victory token, the  
victory token moves to the unit with bounty, if able.

• If a unit with the bounty keyword performs an attack  
against an enemy unit with a victory token, and that unit  
uses the Emergency Stims upgrade card, when the unit  
suffers the wounds on Emergency Stims at the end of that  
unit's next activation, if the unit is then defeated, the victory  
token moves to the unit with bounty, if able. 

• If a unit with the bounty keyword causes an enemy unit  
with a victory token to receive one or more poison tokens,  
when the unit suffers wounds due to those poison tokens at  
the end of its next activation, if the unit is then defeated, the  
victory token moves to the unit with bounty, if able. 

• If a unit with the bounty keyword performs an attack  
against an enemy unit that is transporting a unit with a  
victory token, and causes the transported unit with a victory  
token to be defeated, the victory token moves to the unit  
with bounty, if able.  

• After setup, if both players have units with the bounty  
keyword, the blue player places victory tokens first, then the  
red player places victory tokens.

• When playing a game that uses scenario battle cards, such  
as those found in the Downed AT-ST expansion, unless  
otherwise stated, the bounty keyword cannot be used.  

» Scenario battle cards have a scenario icon in the top  
right corner of the card.
