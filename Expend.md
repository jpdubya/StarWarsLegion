[[Exhaust]], [[Supply Deck]], [[Upgrade cards]]

A player must expend some upgrade cards to  
resolve the abilities on those cards. Once a card is  
expended, it cannot be used again for the rest of  
that game.  

• If a card has an expend icon, it requires the  
player to expend it in order to use its abilities.

• To expend a card, a player rotates it 180º so it is  
oriented upside down. This indicates that the card has  
been expended.  

• Expended cards cannot be unexpended by any game effect.  

• All upgrade cards begin the game unexpended.  

• A card that does not have an expend icon cannot be  
expended.  

• The points value of expended cards equipped to units that  
are defeated are still counted when determining the total  
points value of defeated units.
