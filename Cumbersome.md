[[Attack]], [[Movement]], [[Weapons]]

A unit that has a weapon with the cumbersome keyword  
cannot both move and attack using that weapon during the  
same activation, unless the move is a pivot.  

• If a unit performs an attack with a weapon that has the  
cumbersome keyword during its activation, it cannot  
perform any moves during that activation, except for pivots. 

• If a unit performs a move, except for a pivot, during its  
activation, it cannot perform an attack with a weapon that  
has the cumbersome keyword during that activation.  

• A unit can use a weapon with the cumbersome keyword  
during an attack triggered by spending a standby token, even if  
that unit moved during its activation earlier in the same round.
