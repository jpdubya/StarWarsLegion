[[Attack]], [[Objective Cards Range]]

![[Pasted image 20220120202258.png]]

Some units appear to be on the enemy’s side of  
a conflict—until they get close enough to reveal  
their true allegiances. A unit with the incognito  
keyword cannot be attacked by enemy units that are  
beyond range 1 of it. Additionally, its unit leader is  
not counted by objective cards.  

If a unit with the incognito keyword ever  
performs an objective card action, performs an attack, or  
defends against an enemy attack, during that game, it loses the  
effects of the incognito keyword and can now be attacked  
by enemies as normal and is treated as a unit leader by  
objective cards.  

• Objective card actions include any card actions or free card  
actions that units gain from the text of an objective card.  
» Examples of objective cards with objective card actions  
include Recover the Supplies, Sabotage the Moisture  
Vaporators, Hostage Exchange, and Bombing Run.

• Units currently under the effect of the incognito  
keyword are not treated as unit leaders for the purposes of  
objective cards.  
» Examples of objective cards that interact with unit  
leaders include Bombing Run, Breakthrough, Intercept  
the Transmissions, Key Positions, and Payload.  

• Attacks made by condition cards, objective cards, objective  
tokens, condition tokens, or charge tokens are not  
considered enemy attacks. Only attacks made by enemy  
units are considered enemy attacks.  

• An incognito token may be used by a player to mark that a  
unit is under the effects of the incognito keyword. Remove  
the token if the unit attacks, defends against an enemy  
attack, or performs an objective card action.
