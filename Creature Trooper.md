A creature trooper is a type of unit. It is a subtype of the trooper  
unit type.  

• Game effects that target or apply to troopers can target or  
apply to creature troopers.  

• Creature trooper units follow the same rules as trooper units  
with the following exceptions:

» Creature troopers are affixed to either a medium, large,  
or huge base.  
» When a creature trooper performs a standard move, the  
player inserts the movement tool into the front notch of  
the mini’s base.  
» Creature troopers do not improve their cover while they  
have one or more suppression tokens.  
» Barricades do not provide cover to creature troopers.  
» Creature troopers can obscure other minis, and provide  
light cover when doing so.  
» Creature troopers cannot climb or clamber.  
» Creature troopers can pivot and reverse.  
» Creature troopers cannot embark or disembark.  
» Creature troopers cannot use the “Claim” or “Sabotage/  
Repair” abilities.  
» Creature troopers cannot be displaced.
» Troopers and ground vehicles cannot move through  
creature troopers.  
» A unit cannot end a compulsory move overlapping a  
creature trooper.  
» Creature troopers displace troopers when moving  
through them, and cannot move through troopers that  
cannot be displaced.  
» When a creature trooper withdraws, it can perform free  
actions and use abilities. It must still spend all available  
actions and performs a speed-1 move.  
» While withdrawing, creature trooper minis can displace  
non-creature, non-emplacement trooper minis with  
which they are engaged.
