The scale keyword allows a unit to traverse the battlefield with  
startling agility. When a unit with the scale keyword performs  
a move action, it may either perform a free clamber action  
before performing that move or perform a free clamber action  
after performing that move.

• Move actions that can trigger the scale keyword include  
standard moves, climb, clamber, and disembark.  
» A unit with the scale keyword can use scale in  
combination with a clamber action move up or down a  
distance up to height 2.  
» A unit with the scale keyword can use scale in  
combination with a clamber action to move up and over  
a fence, wall, or other obstruction that a mini cannot be  
placed on top of, up to height 1.

it does not reduce its speed for moving out of, into, or  
through difficult terrain.

not roll any white defense dice or suffer wounds.  

• A unit cannot use the scale keyword after withdrawing
