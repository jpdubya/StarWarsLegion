[[Command Cards]]

Some command cards have the divulge keyword. These cards  
can be revealed at the start of the Phase or step stated after the  
divulge keyword on the command card. 

If a card is divulged in this manner, resolve the text that follows  
the divulge keyword.  

• A card that is revealed in this way is not played, and is  
returned to that player’s command had at the end of the step  
in which it was divulged.  

• If both players have command cards with the same divulge  
keyword timing, the blue player has the opportunity to  
reveal their command card first. If this opportunity is  
declined, the card can no longer be divulged.  

• Command cards that contain the divulge keyword are  
divided by a horizontal line. This line serves to visually  
separate the divulge keyword effect from the normal  
command card effect.
