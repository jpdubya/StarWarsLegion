[[Abilities]], [[Activating Units]], [[Arsenal X]] (Unit  
Keyword), [[Attack Pool]], [[Keywords]], [[Order Tokens]]

When another friendly unit performs a ranged attack, a unit that  
has the fire support keyword and a faceup order token may  
add eligible weapons to the attack pool.

• During the “Form Attack Pool” step of a friendly unit’s ranged  
attack, each mini in a unit with the fire support keyword  
may contribute an eligible weapon to the attack pool if that  
mini has line of sight to any mini in the defending unit.  

• A weapon is considered eligible if it is a ranged weapon, if  
the defending unit is at the weapon’s range, and if any other  
requirements of using the weapon are met.  
» When a unit is using the fire support keyword, range  
from that unit is still measured from ==its own== unit leader.  

• To use the fire support keyword, a unit must legally be  
able to perform a ranged attack, even though using the fire  
support keyword is not considered to be an attack made by  
that unit.  
» A unit cannot use the fire support keyword if it  
is engaged.  

• Any weapons added to an attack pool also add their weapon  
keywords to that attack pool.

• If a unit using the fire support keyword also has the  
**[[arsenal x]]** keyword, each mini can contribute x eligible  
weapons to the attack pool.  

• To use the fire support keyword, a unit must have a  
faceup order token. After using the fire support keyword,  
a unit must flip that order token facedown. That unit is  
considered to have activated and cannot be activated during  
that round.  

• After contributing eligible weapons to an attack pool, a unit  
has used fire support. A unit can use the fire support  
keyword to contribute eligible weapons to only one attack
pool.
» If a unit is able to use fire support without flipping  
its order token facedown, it can use fire support to  
contribute eligible weapons to subsequent attack pools.  

• Only one unit can use the fire support keyword while  
another unit is forming an attack pool. Two or more units  
cannot use the fire support keyword to add eligible  
weapons to the same attack pool.  

• When determining which defending minis can suffer  
wounds, line of sight is determined from the attacking unit,  
and not the unit using the fire support keyword.
