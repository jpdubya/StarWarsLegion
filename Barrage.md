[[Actions]], [[Arsenal X]] (Unit Keyword), [[Attack]]

A unit with the **barrage** keyword can hold its position and  
unleash a torrent of fire against its enemies. As long as the unit  
does not use the **arsenal** keyword during its activation, it can  
perform up to 2 attack actions, instead of 1.  

• A unit using the **barrage** keyword must still spend actions  
to perform attack actions.  

• In order to use the **barrage** keyword, a unit cannot use  
the **arsenal** keyword at any time during its activation. If it  
uses **arsenal** for its first attack, it cannot perform a second  
attack using **barrage**.
