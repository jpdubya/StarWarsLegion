 [[Attack Pool]], [[Ion Tokens]], [[Vehicles]], [[Weapons]]

The ion x keyword is used to force enemy units to gain  
ion tokens.  

• A vehicle or droid trooper unit that suffers wounds after  
defending against an attack that includes a weapon with the  
ion x keyword gains x ion tokens.  

• At the start of the “Roll Defense Dice” step, before any other  
effects, if the attack pool includes the ion x keyword, for  
each hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) or critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) result, up to x, the defender must  
flip an active shield token if able. The defender does not add  
block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results for shield tokens flipped in this way.
