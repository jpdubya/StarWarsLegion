In the End Phase, players prepare for the next round. In order  
to resolve the End Phase, players perform the following steps  
in order:  

1. **Discard Command Card**: Each player discards their  
revealed command card; it cannot be used again this game.  
» If a player used the “Standing Orders” command card or  
was unable to play a command card this round, they will  
not have a card to discard.  

2. **Remove Tokens**: Players remove all aim, dodge, and standby  
tokens from their units, as well as one suppression token  
from each unit.  

3. **Update Order Pool and Promote**: Each player places one of  
their order tokens on each of their undefeated units’ cards  
with a matching rank.
» Excess order tokens are removed from the game. If all  
of a player’s commanders were defeated, starting with  
the blue player, players must promote a unit leader from  
one of their trooper units to be a commander, placing  
the commander token in the play area next to that mini.  
Then, that unit’s original order token is discarded, and a  
commander order token is placed on that unit’s card in  
its place.  
» In the rare instance where a player no longer has  
a trooper unit to promote, they no longer have a  
commander and cannot play command cards.

4. **Advance Round Counter**: The player who has the round  
counter sets it so the next highest number is displayed; that  
is the number of the next round. Then, that player passes the  
round counter to their opponent.  
» After the sixth game round, the game ends.
