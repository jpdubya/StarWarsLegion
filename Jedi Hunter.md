[[Abilities]], [[Attack]], [[Upgrade Cards]]

A unit with the jedi hunter keyword has dedicated itself to the  
pursuit and defeat of the Jedi Order. When attacking a unit with  
a ![[ForceIcon.png]] upgrade icon, a unit with the jedi hunter keyword gains  
“ ![[AttackSurgeIcon.png]] : ![[CritIcon.png]]”.  

• The jedi hunter keyword can be used against a unit that  
does not have a ![[ForceIcon.png]] upgrade equipped, as long as it has the ![[ForceIcon.png]]  
upgrade icon.
