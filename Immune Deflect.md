[[Attack]], [[Deflect]] (Unit Keyword)

During an attack that includes a weapon with the immune:  
deflect keyword, if the only weapons in the attack pool are  
weapons with the immune: deflect keyword, the attacking  
unit cannot suffer wounds due to the defending unit using the  
**[[deflect]]**, **[[djem so mastery]]**, or **[[soresu mastery]]** abilities.  

â€¢ The defending unit can still gain the benefits of the other  
effects of the deflect, djem so mastery, and soresu  
mastery keywords.
