[[Unit]], [[Unit Leader]]

If an upgrade that adds a miniature to a unit has the leader  
keyword, treat the mini added by that upgrade as that unit’s  
unit leader.  

• If a unit leader mini that was added by an upgrade card  
with the leader keyword is defeated, replace one of the  
remaining minis in that unit with the leader mini from  
that upgrade card.  
» If a mini with the leader keyword and a wound  
threshhold of 2 is defeated while in a unit with a wound  
threshhold of 1, replace one of the remaining minis  
in that unit as normal, then assign the mini with the  
leader keyword 1 wound token.  

• Only one upgrade card with the leader keyword can be  
equipped to each unit.
