[[Attack]], [[Inconspicuous]] (Unit Keyword), [[Line of Sight]]

A unit with the distract keyword can keep enemies occupied  
or provide valuable misdirection. As a free card action, a unit  
with the distract keyword can choose an enemy trooper unit  
at range 1-2 and in line of sight; until the end of that round,  
when the chosen enemy unit performs an attack, it must attack  
the unit that used the distract ability, if able.  

• When a unit uses the distract ability, it loses the  
**[[inconspicuous]]** keyword until the end of the round, if able. 

• While attacking, each mini in the enemy unit must add an  
eligible weapon to the attack pool that is targeting the unit  
that used the distract ability, if able.  
» A unit, or mini, cannot “choose” a weapon that is not  
eligible to be added to that dice pool if it can add a  
different weapon that is eligible.  
» The attacking unit can only form a second dice pool if,  
after first forming a dice pool with all eligible weapons,  
there are still weapons usable by any minis in the unit  
that were not eligible to be added to the first attack pool  
targeting the unit that used the distract ability.
