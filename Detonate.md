When a token detonates, either through an ability or some  
other game effect, perform a separate attack against each unit  
(regardless of which player owns that unit) that the token has  
line of sight to, using the area weapon, surge conversion chart,  
and weapon keywords on the card associated with the token  
that is being detonated.  

After a token detonates, remove that token from the battlefield.  

• A yellow range icon (![[RangeIcon.png]]) indicates that a weapon  
is an area weapon. When a charge or condition token  
detonates, use the area weapon on the card associated with  
that token.  

• When using an area weapon, perform a separate attack  
against each unit that is in line of sight and at the range  
indicated by the number on the range icon, determined
from the edge of the charge or condition token that  
is detonating.  

• For each attack made when a token detonates, that token is  
considered the attacker.  

• When a token detonates, refer to the surge conversion chart  
associated with that token, regardless of whether a unit  
placed that token or used an ability to detonate it.  

• When a token detonates, units cannot spend aim tokens to  
modify attack dice, regardless of whether a unit placed that  
token or used an ability to detonate it.  

• When a token detonates, if there are multiple defending  
units, the player who controls the unit that used an ability to  
detonate the token chooses the order of the attacks made by  
the charge token.  

• If a token would detonate after a unit performs a move or  
any action, that token detonates before any other abilities or  
effects that occur after a unit moves or performs an action;  
with the exception of spending a standby token which can  
be spent by a unit before the token detonates.  

• Ranged attacks made by area weapons are performed against  
each unit at range and in line of sight, even if that unit  
is engaged.  

• To determine line of sight from a token to a unit, determine  
line of sight from the unit to the token instead. If any minis  
in the unit have line of sight to the token, then the token has  
line of sight to that unit and to those minis.

• When a token detonates, if there are multiple defending  
units, the player who controls the unit that caused the token  
to detonate chooses the order of the attacks made by the  
condition token.  

• Each attack made when a token detonates is a ranged attack.
