[[Commander]], [[Infiltrate]], [[Operative]], [[Rank]]

A unit with the covert ops keyword is able to  
forgo their command position to infiltrate onto the  
battlefield as an independent operative. When a unit  
with the covert ops keyword deploys, it may treat  
its rank as operative instead of commander to gain  
the **[[infiltrate]]** keyword.

• When a unit uses covert ops to change its rank to  
operative, if there is not another unit with the commander  
rank in that player’s army, that player must immediately  
promote a unit with the rank of corps or special forces to  
the rank of commander. Place a commander token near that  
unit, and remove their order token from the game, replacing  
it with a commander order token.
» The promoted unit can be one that has already deployed  
or that has not deployed yet.  


• When a unit uses covert ops to change its rank to  
operative, its rank is treated as operative for that entire  
game. Add an operative order token to the order pool for  
that unit (instead of a commander order token). Place an  
operative marker token near the unit on the battlefield to  
remind players of that unit’s operative rank.  
» That unit is issued orders and activated with an operative  
order token for that game.  
» A unit with the rank of operative cannot be nominated  
to issue orders when a non-operative specific command  
card is played and friendly units cannot use an  
operative’s courage value when checking whether  
they panic.
