Each player resolves a command card during the Command Phase  
of each game round.  

• Each player begins the game with a hand of seven  
command cards.  

» A player must include two 1-pip cards, two 2-pip cards,  
two 3-pip cards, and the card “Standing Orders” in their  
command hand.  

» A player cannot include more than one copy of any  
command card in their command hand.


• There are four command cards available to all commanders:  
“Ambush,” “Push,” “Assault,” and “Standing Orders.”  


• Each commander and operative has at least three command  
cards specific to that character that can only be used if that  
character is included in that army.  

» Character-specific command cards are identified by the  
name of that character appearing below the name of the  
command card.  

» If a player's character has access to more than three  
character-specific command cards, that player can include  
any number of those cards in their command hand, so long
as they follow all command hand rules.


• Each command card has a number of pips in the upper-left  
corner of the card. These are used to determine which player  
has priority each round.  


• Each command card indicates the number and type of units  
that can be issued orders, or it indicates the name or names of  
specific units that can be issued orders.  


• Any units indicated on a command card can be issued  
orders only if they are at range 1–3 of the nominated unit. A  
nominated unit is at range 1 of itself.  


• A player must issue orders to as many units indicated on a  
command card as possible.  


• Some command cards have unique effects when they  
are played.  

» If no specific timing is provided, the effect is resolved  
after command cards have been revealed.  

» If both players play a command card with a unique card  
effect that does not have a specific timing, the blue player  
resolves the game effect on their command card first.  

» If a player plays a command card with a unique card  
effect that is resolved when that card is revealed, that  
game effect is resolved before any command card game  
effects without a specific timing.  

_For example, the blue player reveals "Annihilation Looms"  
and the red player reveals "Change of Plans." The red  
player chooses to return "Annihilation Looms" to their  
opponent's hand, and its effect does not resolve. _ 

» If both players play a command card with a unique card  
effect that is resolved when that card is revealed, the  
blue player resolves the game effect on their command  
card first.  

» If both players play a command card with a unique  
card effect that is resolved at the start of the Activation  
Phase, the blue player resolves the game effect on their  
command card first.


• Each command card that has not been returned to a player’s  
command hand is discarded during the End Phase and its  
effect ends.  


• During the Command Phase, a player must play a command  
card, if able.  


• If a player cannot play a command card, and their opponent  
does, their opponent has priority regardless of how many  
pips are on their played command card.  


• If neither player can play a command card, the player with  
the round counter rolls a red die to determine which player  
has priority, as if both players had played command cards  
with the same number of pips (see “Priority” on page 65).  


• If a player’s character is defeated, any character-specific  
command cards corresponding to that character cannot be  
played during the Command Phase.  


• If a player reveals an illegal command card during the  
Command Phase, they replace that card with the “Standing  
Orders” command card, if able.  


• When playing an operative’s command card, the player does  
not nominate a commander; instead they nominate the  
operative, and that operative issues orders.  


• When playing a non-operative-specific command card, a  
player cannot nominate an operative to issue orders. 


• A player's command hand is not public knowledge, and its  
contents should remain secret to their opponents.  

» However, the number of cards in a player's command  
hand is public knowledge.  


• A player’s discard pile is public knowledge, and an opponent  
may ask to view a player's discard pile at any time.  

» When a player returns a command card to their  
command hand from their discard pile, they must tell  
their opponent which card was returned.  


• Some command cards allow specific units to gain keywords.  
The specified unit has that keyword as long as the command  
card is in play.


• Some command cards contain weapon profiles. Typically  
there are two ways these weapon profiles can be used: a unit  
specified by the command card gains the weapon on the  
card and can use it during its activation, or a unit specified  
by the command card may perform an attack using the  
weapon on the card at the end of its activation.  

» If a unit gains a weapon from a command card, that  
weapon is treated as though it is on the unit's unit card.  

» If a unit may perform an attack with a weapon on a  
command card, it cannot use the arsenal x keyword  
to add additional weapons to the attack pool; the attack  
must be made only with the weapon on the command  
card. This does not apply to a weapon that a unit gains  
via a command card, as that weapon is considered to be  
on its unit card.  

» If a unit may perform an attack with a weapon on a  
command card, it must be able to perform an attack of  
the type specified by the range icon of the weapon. An  
engaged trooper unit cannot perform ranged attacks,  
unless the weapon has the versatile keyword.  

» If a unit gains a weapon from a command card, a  
counterpart that is a part of that unit does not gain that  
weapon, unless otherwise stated by a card effect.
