When an observation token is assigned to a unit,  
it means that the enemy has gained an advantage  
over them by observing some critical weakness  
or flaw. Various effects can cause enemy units  
to gain observation tokens. During an attack,  
the attacking unit can spend any observation  
tokens that belong to the defending unit. The  
attacker rerolls one attack die for each observation token spent.  
Observation tokens are removed at the end of each round.  
• Observation tokens are spent by the attacker during the  
“Reroll Dice” substep of the “Roll Attack Dice” step of  
an attack.  
• Observation tokens are spent one at a time; reroll one attack  
die each time an observation token is spent. The same die  
can be rerolled multiple times by spending subsequent  
observation tokens or aim tokens.  
• The attacker may spend aim tokens and observation tokens  
in any order.
• Observation tokens are placed on the battlefield near to the  
unit that gained them, and remain with the unit as it moves  
around the battlefield.  
• A unit cannot spend its own observation tokens.
