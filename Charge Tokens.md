Each charge token has a unique type and  
can be identified by a unique icon on the  
charge token itself. Each charge token type  
matches an arm x: charge type keyword  
and a detonate x: charge type keyword  
that indicates how the token is placed on  
the battlefield and how it is detonated.  
• Charge tokens cannot overlap any objective, condition, or  
other charge tokens, and must be placed on a flat surface,  
completely flush with that surface.  
• When placing charge tokens, the blue player should place  
their charge tokens with the blue side faceup, and the  
red player should place their charge tokens with the red  
side faceup.
