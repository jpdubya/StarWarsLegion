Units can perform attacks to attempt to defeat enemy units.  

• A unit typically performs an attack by performing an attack  
action during its activation.  

• During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to perform  
more than one attack through the use of card abilities or  
other game effects; however, that unit can only perform  
one attack action during a single activation, regardless of  
whether it is an attack action or a free attack action.  

• During an attack, the unit that is performing the attack is the  
attacker and the target of the attack is the defender.  
	» Multiple units can be chosen as defenders (see step 3).
	
• There are two types of attacks: ranged and melee.  
	» During a ranged attack, the attacker and defender are not  
in a melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that  
have a blue range ![[RangeIcon.png]] icon.
	» During a melee attack, the attacker and defender are in a  
melee, and the attacker can use only weapons that have a  
red melee (![[Pics/MeleeIcon.png]]) icon.  

• Command cards, unit abilities, and other game effects can  
allow units to perform attacks. The card granting the attack  
will specify whether the attack is an attack action, a free  
attack action, or neither.  

• To perform an attack, a player resolves the following steps:  

1. **Declare Defender**: The attacking player chooses one enemy  
unit to attack; this enemy unit is now the defender. Then, the  
attacking player measures the range from the attacker’s unit  
leader to the closest miniature of the defender to determine  
the attack’s range. 

2. **Form Attack Pool**: The attack pool consists of all the dice  
the attacker will roll against this defender. When forming  
the attack pool, players follow these substeps in order:  
	a. **_Determine Eligible Minis_**: Each mini in the attacker is  
eligible to contribute to the attack pool if that mini has  
line of sight to any mini in the defender.  
	b. **_Choose Weapons_**: The attacker can choose one weapon  
from each eligible mini to contribute to the attack  
pool. To choose a weapon, the attacker must meet all  
requirements indicated by that weapon’s keywords, and  
that weapon’s range must include the range of the attack,  
as determined from the attacker’s unit leader to the  
closest mini of the defender.  
	c. **_Gather Dice_**: For each eligible mini that chose a  
weapon, the attacker gathers the number and type of  
dice depicted on that weapon and places them on the  
battlefield near the defender.  

3. **Declare Additional Defender**: If there are any weapons  
remaining that have not been added to the attack pool, the  
player may repeat steps 1–2, forming a separate attack pool  
with the new weapons.

4. **Roll Attack Dice**: The attacker chooses an attack pool and  
resolves the following substeps in order:  
	a. **_Roll Dice_**: The attacker rolls the dice in the attack pool.  
	b. **_Reroll Dice_**: The attacker can resolve any abilities that  
allow the attacker to reroll attack dice.  
	c. **_Convert Attack Surges_**: The attacker changes its attack  
surge (![[AttackSurgeIcon.png]]) results to the result indicated on its unit card  
by turning the die. If no result is indicated, the attacker  
changes the result to a blank.  

5. **Apply Dodge and Cover**: If the defender has a dodge token  
or is in cover, the defender may spend dodge tokens and  
apply cover to cancel hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results. Dodge tokens and  
cover cannot be used to cancel critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results.  
	» A unit can apply cover only against ranged attacks.  
	
6. **Modify Attack Dice**: The ==attacker== can resolve any card  
abilities that modify the attack dice. Then, the ==defender== can  
resolve any card abilities that modify the attack dice.  

7. **Roll Defense Dice**: Resolve the following substeps in order:  
	a. **_Roll Dice_**: For each hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) and critical (![[CritIcon.png]])) result on the attacker’s dice, the defender rolls one defense die whose  
color matches the defender’s defense, which is presented  
on the defender’s unit card.
	b. **_Reroll Dice_**: The defender can resolve any abilities that  
allow the defender to reroll defense dice.  
	c. **_Convert Defense Surges_**: The defender changes its  
defense surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]) results to the result indicated on its  
unit card by turning the die. If no result is indicated, the  
defender changes the result to a blank.  

8. **Modify Defense Dice**: The ==defender== can resolve any card  
abilities that modify the defense dice. Then, the ==attacker== can  
resolve any card abilities that modify the defense dice.  

9. **Compare Results**: The attacker counts the number of hit  
(![[HitIcon.png]]) and critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results, and the defender counts the  
number of block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results. Then, the defender’s total is  
subtracted from the attacker’s total, and if the attacker’s total  
is greater, the defender suffers a number of wounds equal to  
the difference.  
	» Critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results have no additional effect.  

10. **Choose Additional Attack Pool**: If the attacker has an  
attack pool that he has not rolled, the attacker repeats steps  
4–9, choosing a new attack pool and rolling it against the  
defender it has been assigned to.
[[#Choose Additional Attack Pool]]


# Declare Additional Defender
» Each eligible mini can contribute a weapon to only one  
attack pool, unless it has the **arsenal x** keyword and  
can use more than one weapon during an attack.  
» An attack pool can consist of dice from different  
weapons, but all weapons with an identical name must  
contribute their dice to the same attack pool.  
» The dice in each attack pool should be placed near the  
corresponding defender.  

# Choose Additional Attack Pool
» After resolving each attack pool, if at any point the  
attack dice in the attack pool produced at least one  
hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) or critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) result, the attack was ranged,  
and the defender is a trooper, the defender gains a  
suppression token.  
» When an attacking unit forms multiple attack pools,  
resolving each attack pool is treated as an attack for all  
gameplay effects and abilities, however the unit is still  
considered to have performed only one single attack or  
attack action.  
» An enemy unit cannot spend a standby token until each  
attack pool has been fully resolved.  
» A unit cannot use the **detonate x** keyword until each  
attack pool has been fully resolved.
