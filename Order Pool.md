[[Activating Units]], [[Activation Phase]], [[Command Cards]],
[[Command Phase]], [[Commander]], [[Issuing Orders]], [[Order Tokens]],
[[Rank]]

During the Command Phase, each player creates an order pool  
that consists of the order tokens that the player did not issue  
while resolving their command card.  
• When activating a unit during the Activation Phase, a player  
can choose to take an order token at random from their  
order pool.  
» Then, the player activates a unit with a rank that  
corresponds to the rank on the order token they took.  
• It is recommended that players create their order pool by  
placing their order tokens in an opaque bag or container;  
however, players can also create their order pool by placing  
their order tokens facedown in a randomized stack near  
the battlefield.
• If a player draws a token that does not match the rank of a  
unit they have in play, that token is removed from the order  
pool and a new one is drawn.
