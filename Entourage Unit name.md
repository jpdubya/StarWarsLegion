[[Command Phase]], [[Issuing Orders]], [[Army Building]]

The entourage keyword indicates that a unit is often  
accompanied or protected by another specific unit. The  
entourage keyword specifically states the name of this other  
unit. When building an army, if a player includes a unit with the  
entourage keyword, they may ignore the rank (but not points  
value) of a unit that has the name specified by the entourage  
keyword. Ignoring the rank of a unit means that the unit’s rank  
does not count against the rank restrictions for building an  
army. This may cause an army to have more units of a specific  
rank than the rules for building an army normally allow;  
because of the entourage keyword, such an army still meets  
the rules for building an army of that type.  

Each Command Phase, during the Issue Orders step, a  
unit with the entourage keyword may issue an order to a  
friendly unit at range 1–2 that has the name specified by the  
entourage keyword.  

• Orders issued with the entourage keyword are considered  
to be issued by the unit that has the entourage keyword.

• Game effects that trigger when a unit is issued an order,  
such as those on command cards, trigger when a unit is  
issued an order by the entourage keyword.  

• Game effects that alter the range at which a unit issues  
orders or can be issued orders, such as from upgrade cards,  
can effect the range of the entourage keyword.  

• When issuing an order via the entourage keyword, the  
order ==must== be issued to a unit that has the name specified by  
the entourage keyword, however other game effects that  
trigger ==when== a unit is issued an order may cause the order to  
be issued to a different unit instead.
