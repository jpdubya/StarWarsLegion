[[Command Cards]], [[Command Phase]]

Some characters, both heroes and villains, think a couple  
steps ahead and have more than one plan to fall back on.  
While building a command hand, for each unit with the **contingencies x** keyword in a player’s army, that player sets aside up to x additional command cards as contingency cards, where x is equal to the ==combined== **contingencies x** value on  
their units. These set-aside cards can have any number of pips  
but must follow all other command hand rules as if they were  
chosen for that player’s command hand.  

After a player reveals a command card, before any other effects  
are resolved, that player may discard it to reveal one of their set-  
aside contingency cards instead. The revealed contingency card  
is then treated as a selected and revealed command card. The  
number of pips on the revealed contingency card must be equal  
to the number of pips on the discarded card.


• Only command cards can be set aside as contingency cards. 


• Contingency cards are chosen and set aside while building  
an army.  


• Contingency cards are not considered to be in a player’s  
command hand. 


• When choosing contingency cards, a player cannot choose  
a card with the same name as another of their contingency  
cards or a card in their command hand.  


• When choosing contingency cards, a player cannot choose a  
card with a unit name in the upper right that does not match  
the name of a unit in their army.  


• Contingency cards are set-aside facedown. Like a player’s  
command hand, they are considered to be hidden  
information. A player can look at their own contingency  
cards at any time.


• A contingency card can be reveled only if it could legally be  
played as a command card. If a player reveals a contingency  
card that cannot legally be played as a command card, it is  
discarded and that player does not play a command card for  
that round.  


• If both players have set-aside contingency cards, the blue  
player must decide whether or not to reveal a contingency  
card before the red player decides whether to reveal a  
contingency card.  


• If all friendly units with **contingencies x** are defeated, a  
player cannot reveal or use their contingency cards.
