[[Weapons]]

A weapon with a blue range icon (󲉬󲉭󲉮󲉯󲖀󲉰)  
is a ranged weapon. Ranged weapons can only  
be used during ranged attacks or while using the  
fire support keyword.  
• If a unit has multiple minis each using a ranged weapon,  
each ranged weapon with the same name must be added to  
the same attack pool. Ranged weapons with different names  
may be added to different attack pools.  
• A ranged weapon cannot be in the same attack pool as a  
non-ranged weapon.
