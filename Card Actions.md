A card action is a type of action. If an ability is preceded by a  
card action (![[CardActionIcon.png]]) icon, that ability is a card action.  
• Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform  
different card actions during its activation. However, a unit  
cannot perform the same card action more than once during  
its activation.  
• If a card action provides a unit with either a move or an  
attack that is not treated as a move action or an attack  
action, performing that move or attack is different than  
performing a move action or attack action, even though the  
result is the same.
• Some card actions are treated as other types of actions, such  
as a move action or an attack action. This is indicated in the  
text of the card action itself. When a unit performs that card  
action, treat that action as the type of action indicated in its  
text, as well as a card action, for the purposes of all gameplay  
effects and abilities, including triggering other abilities that  
occur after the indicated action.  
For example, after performing a move, if Darth Vader is  
equipped with the Saber Throw upgrade card, he can use the  
relentless ability to perform a ranged attack using the Saber  
Throw card action.  
• Card actions can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and  
standby tokens. If a card action specifically instructs a  
unit to gain an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is  
different than performing an aim, dodge, or standby action  
and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim,  
dodge, or standby actions are performed.
