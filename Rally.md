[[Activating Units]], [[Courage]], [[Suppression]], [[Panic]]

When a unit activates, it rallies, in an attempt to shake off  
suppression and to avoid panicking.  

• During the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, the player  
who controls that unit rolls one white defense die for each  
suppression token that unit has. Then, one suppression  
token is removed from that unit for each block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) or  
defense surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]) result the roll produces.  

• If a trooper unit ever has a number of suppression tokens  
assigned to it that is equal to or greater than that unit's  
courage value, that unit is suppressed.  

• Immediately after the “Rally” step of a trooper unit’s  
activation, if that unit is suppressed, it loses one of its two  
actions for that activation.

• A unit cannot lose an action due to gaining suppression  
tokens and becoming suppressed after it has already  
performed its "Rally" step. Nor can a unit regain a lost  
action by removing suppression tokens and no longer  
be suppressed.  

• Immediately after the “Rally” step of a trooper unit’s  
activation, if that unit has a number of suppression tokens  
equal to or greater than twice its courage value, it panics.  
During a panicked unit’s activation, it cannot perform free  
actions and must use its entire activation to perform a single  
move at its maximum speed as directly as possible toward  
the nearest edge of the battlefield.  
» If the unit leader ends this movement with any part of its  
base outside of the battlefield, the unit is defeated.  
» If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may  
use that commander’s courage value instead of its own  
when checking to see if it is panicked.

• A unit without any suppression tokens, including vehicles,  
is considered to perform a "Rally" step, for the purposes of  
game effects, even though the owner of that unit does not  
roll any dice to remove suppression tokens.
