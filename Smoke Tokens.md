[[Attack]], [[Cover]], [[Smoke X]]

Clouds of smoke on the battlefield can provide  
tactical cover to troops. Trooper units whose unit  
leader is at range 1 of a smoke token improve their  
cover by 1. While a trooper unit is attacking, if the  
attacking unit leader is at range 1 of a smoke token,  
the defender improves their cover by 1. Smoke  
tokens are removed at the end of each round.  
• A vehicle unit at range 1 of a smoke token does not improve  
its cover, and units defending against a vehicle unit whose  
unit leader is at range 1 of a smoke token do not improve  
their cover.  
• During the End Phase, all smoke tokens are returned to  
the supply.  
• Effects that improve a unit's cover are cumulative.

_For example, a unit whose unit leader is at range 1 of two  
smoke tokens would improve its cover by 2._
