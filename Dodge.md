[[Actions]], [[Attack]], [[Cancel]], [[Dice]]

Units can gain dodge tokens that allow them to  
cancel hit results during an attack.  

• When a unit performs a dodge action, that unit  
gains a dodge token. The token is placed on the  
battlefield near the unit leader and will remain  
with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.  

• During the “[[Apply Dodge and Cover]]” step of an attack, a  
unit can spend one or more dodge tokens to cancel one hit  
(![[HitIcon.png]]) result for each dodge token spent.  

• Dodge tokens cannot be spent to cancel critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results.  

• To spend a unit’s dodge token, a player removes it from the  
battlefield and places it in the supply.  

• During the End Phase, all of a unit’s unspent dodge tokens  
are removed from the battlefield.  

• When a unit spends a dodge token to trigger the **[[deflect]]**  
keyword, that unit also receives the benefit of that dodge  
token in addition to the effects of deflect.

• Unit abilities and other effects can allow units to gain dodge  
tokens. If an effect specifically instructs a unit to gain a  
dodge token, that effect is different than performing a dodge  
action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur  
after dodge actions are performed.  

• During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to gain  
more than one dodge token; however, that unit can only  
gain one dodge token from performing a dodge action  
during a single activation.  

• A unit may spend a dodge token even if there are no hits  
to cancel.
