Range is the distance between two miniatures on the battlefield.  
• Melee range is when a mini is in base contact with an enemy  
mini. Those minis are at melee range with each other.  
• Players measure other ranges using the range ruler. The  
range ruler consists of five segments of equal length. The  
beginning segment represents range 1, the second segment  
represents range 2, etc.  
» The beginning of the range ruler has a flat, raised end.  
» Each range segment is an entire plastic section of the ruler.
• To measure range, a player places the start of the range  
ruler so it touches the base of the mini that range is being  
measured from. Then, they point the range ruler toward  
the mini that range is being measured to. The number of  
segments (and partial segments) of the range ruler that lie  
between the bases of the two minis is the range.  
» If the base of the mini being measured to touches the  
raised line between two range ruler segments without  
crossing it, the mini is at the lower range segment that  
the line separates.
» When a player is measuring using the range ruler,  
that player should use a single edge of the range ruler;  
the player should not factor the width or thickness of  
the ruler.  
» Range is always measured horizontal to the battlefield,  
on a two-dimensional plain. If two minis are on different  
elevations, to measure range, the player should hold the  
range ruler above both minis, level with the battlefield,  
and look down from above to determine range.
» The first range presented on a weapon is that weapon’s  
minimum range; the second range presented on a  
weapon is that weapon’s maximum range.  
» If only a single range is presented on a weapon, it is both  
its minimum and maximum range.  
» To use a weapon during an attack, a unit’s target must be  
at a range that is equal to or greater than the weapons’  
minimum range and equal to or less than the weapon’s  
maximum range.

• When measuring range between units for any game effect  
other than an attack, range is measured from the closest  
mini in one unit to the closest mini in the other unit.  
» During an attack, range is measured from the attacking  
unit leader to the closest mini in the defending unit.  

• Players can use the range ruler to measure distance at any  
time during the game.  

• When measuring to range 5, if players do not have access  
to a fifth segment of the range ruler, they may measure to  
range 1, mark that point, and then measure range 4 from  
that point to determine range 5.  

• The following terms are used when describing range:
» **At**: A unit is at a range if the portion of a miniature’s  
base that is closest to the object from which range is  
being measured is inside the segment that corresponds  
to that range.  
- If the base of the mini being measured to touches  
the raised line between two range-ruler segments
without crossing it, the mini is at the lower range  
segment that the line separates.  
» **Within**: A unit is within a range if the entirety of the  
miniature’s base is inside the segment that corresponds  
to that range.  
- A unit can be within a range that extends through  
multiple segments.  
» **Beyond**: A unit is beyond a range if no portion of the  
miniature’s base is between the first segment of the range  
ruler and the end of the segment that corresponds to the  
specified range.
