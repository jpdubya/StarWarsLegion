[[Abilities]], [[Activating Units]], [[Dice]], [[Wounds]]

At the end of a unit’s activation, if it has the regenerate x  
keyword, it rolls 1 white defense die for each wound token it  
has, up to x. For each block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) or defense surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]) result, it  
removes 1 wound token.  

• If more than one effect takes place at the end of a unit’s  
activation, the player who controls that unit decides the  
order of those effects.
