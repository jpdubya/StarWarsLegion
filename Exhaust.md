A player must exhaust some upgrade cards to  
resolve the abilities on those cards. An exhausted  
card cannot be exhausted again until it is readied.

• If a card has an exhaust icon on the right side  
above its game text, it requires the player to exhaust it in  
order to use its abilities.  

• To exhaust a card, a player rotates it 90º clockwise so it is  
oriented horizontally.  

• When a unit performs a recover action, all of its exhausted  
upgrade cards are readied.  

• To ready an exhausted card, a player rotates it 90º  
counterclockwise so it is oriented vertically.  

• All upgrade cards begin the game readied.  

• A card that does not have an exhaust icon cannot be  
exhausted.
