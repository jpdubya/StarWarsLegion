[[Attack]], [[Dodge]]

During the Apply Dodge and Cover step of an attack, a unit  
with the outmaneuver keyword can spend dodge tokens to  
cancel critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results.  

• To cancel critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results with the outmaneuver  
keyword, a unit spends dodge tokens in the same way it  
would spend them to cancel (![[HitIcon.png]]) results.  

• A unit with the outmaneuver keyword can also spend  
dodge tokens to cancel (![[HitIcon.png]]) results as normal.  

• Dodge tokens spent in this way have no other effect.
