[[Abilities]], [[Attack]], [[Surges]]

While a unit with the **critical x** keyword converts attack  
surges, it may convert up to x attack surge (![[AttackSurgeIcon.png]]) results to critical  
(![[CritIcon.png]]) results.  

â€¢ While using the critical x keyword, a unit still converts  
any attack surge (![[AttackSurgeIcon.png]]) results not converted with the **critical  
x** keyword according to the surge conversion chart on its  
unit card.
