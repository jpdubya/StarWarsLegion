Each miniature is affixed to a base.  

• Most trooper minis are affixed to small round bases. 

• Creature and emplacement trooper minis are affixed to  
notched bases.  

• Ground vehicle minis are affixed to notched bases.  

• Repulsor vehicle minis are affixed to notched bases by clear  
plastic stands.  

• The orientation of a mini affixed to a small round base has
no gameplay implications. A player can freely rotate a mini  
affixed to such a base during its movement.  

• A mini affixed to a notched base cannot be rotated freely;  
during its movement, it must either pivot or move along the  
movement tool, keeping the notches in the base aligned with  
the movement tool.  

• The space created by the notch in a mini's base should  
be treated as a part of that mini's base by other minis.  
Therefore, no mini’s base may be placed inside the notches  
of another mini’s base.
