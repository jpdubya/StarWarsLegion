A free card action is a type of free action. If an ability is  
preceded by a free card action (![[FreeActionIcon.png]]) icon, that ability is a free  
card action. Free card actions do not count against the two  
actions that a unit can perform during its activation.  

• Each free card action is a unique action; a unit can perform  
different free card actions during its activation. However, a  
unit cannot perform the same free card action more than  
once during its activation.  

• Free card actions can be performed only during a  
unit's activation.  

• Free card actions can be performed only when a unit could  
normally perform an action, they cannot be used between  
a game effect and an ability that is triggered by that game  
effect.  

_For example, if Darth Vader performs a move action, he  
cannot then use the free card action on his equipped Force  
Push upgrade card before triggering his **[[relentless]]** ability. He  
must either use the free card action before moving or after the  
relentless ability resolves._

• Card actions can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and  
standby tokens. If a card action specifically instructs a  
unit to gain an aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is  
different than performing an aim, dodge, or standby action  
and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim,  
dodge, or standby actions are performed.
