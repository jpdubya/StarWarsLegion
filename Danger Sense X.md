[[Attack]], [[Dice]], [[Courage]], [[Suppression]]

Units with the danger sense x keyword are more aware of  
the battle raging around them and are adept at staying alive in  
the midst of combat. When a unit with the with the danger  
sense x keyword would remove any number of its suppression  
tokens, it may choose any amount of tokens up to that number  
to remove, including none.  

While defending against an attack, a unit with the danger  
sense x keyword rolls 1 additional defense die for each  
suppression token that it has, adding a total of up to x additional  
dice.  

• Any defense dice added by the danger sense x keyword  
are in addition to the normal number of dice that a unit rolls  
while defending.  

• Any defense dice added by the danger sense x keyword are  
of the same color as the defense dice icon on the defender's  
unit card.  

• A unit that has the danger sense x keyword may choose  
how many of its suppression tokens to remove both during  
its [[Rally]] step and during the [[End Phase]], as well as when  
another game effect or ability would remove its suppression  
tokens.  

• Units can use the danger sense x keyword while defending  
against both ranged and melee attacks.
