[[Cover]], [[Displacement]], [[Height]], [[Movement]],  
[[Reverse]], [[Speeder X]] (Unit Keyword), [[Standby]], [[Strafe]], [[Vehicles]]

Not all repulsor vehicles are speeders, and many use their  
repulsors to hover in mid air, some only a short distance off the  
ground and others many meters above the battlefield. Repulsor  
vehicles that do not have the **[[speeder x]]** keyword will often have  
the hover keyword. Some droid trooper units also have the  
hover keyword. There are two versions of the hover keyword,  
[[#Hover Ground]] and [[#Hover Air]] X. Both versions allow the  
unit to perform the standby action and to reverse, even if it  
cannot normally perform that action or move. Additionally, if  
the unit’s base has side notches, the hover keyword allows it  
to strafe.  

# Hover Ground

• In addition to the above effects, a unit with hover: ground  
is treated as a ground vehicle by other units. This applies  
at all times, including during other units’ activations and  
during this unit’s own activation.
» While determining cover, a unit with hover: ground  
is treated as a ground vehicle and will provide heavy  
cover and block line of sight. Whether a piece of terrain  
provides cover to a unit with hover: ground should  
be determined during setup and is independent of the  
hover: ground keyword.  
» While a unit with hover: ground moves it is treated  
as a ground vehicle and will displace trooper units that  
are able to be displaced. It can move through other  
repulsor vehicles but cannot move through ground
vehicles or trooper units that cannot be displaced. Refer  
to the movement rules for ground vehicles when moving  
through other units.
» While another unit moves, it treats a unit with hover:  
ground as a ground vehicle, and cannot move through  
that unit unless it is a repulsor unit.  
» A unit with hover: ground is only treated as a ground  
vehicle by other units. For all other game effects, the  
unit is still a repulsor vehicle. Importantly, as a repulsor  
vehicle, it is still able to move uninhibited over many  
types of terrain. Refer to "Additional Terrain Rules" on  
page 8 for how repulsor vehicles interact with certain  
types of terrain.

# Hover Air

• A unit with hover: air x ignores terrain of height x  
or lower.  
» While moving it may move over terrain of height x  
or lower.  
» It may end its move on terrain of height x or lower.  
» A unit with hover: air x must still be placed as flat as  
possible on the battlefield after moving. Not all terrain  
that a unit can end their move on is perfectly flat and  
players should agree before playing as to what terrain  
units cannot end their movement on; however, as a  
general rule, if overlapping a piece of terrain causes  
a mini to be unstable or fall over, or causes the mini’s  
base to be at an angle greater than 45 degrees, that mini  
cannot end a move in that position.
