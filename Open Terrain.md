[[Movement]], [[Additional Terrain Rules]]

Open terrain is any area of the battlefield that does not  
hinder movement.

• Units can move through open terrain unimpeded.  

• Whether or not a piece of terrain is open depends on a  
unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle). See  
"Additional Terrain Rules" on page 8.  
» When using custom terrain, it is important to define  
the difficulty of that terrain as it relates to each unit type  
prior to the beginning of the game.

Open terrain is the part of the battlefield that is relatively free  
from obstruction, such as open ground, grassy meadows, and  
flat sandy beaches. Most of the battlefield will generally be open  
terrain. Open terrain neither blocks nor impedes movement.
