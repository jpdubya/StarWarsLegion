[[Attack]], [[Cancel]], [[Impact X]] (Weapon Keyword),  
[[Weak Point X Rear/Sides]] (Unit Keyword)

During the “Modify Attack Dice” step of an attack, if the  
defender has the **armor** keyword, that unit can cancel all hit  
(![[HitIcon.png]]) results produced by the attack roll.

• The attacker resolves abilities during the “Modify Attack  
Dice” step of an attack before the defender resolves abilities  
during that step. As such, the **[[Impact]]** keyword can be used  
to change hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results to critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results before the armor keyword can be used to cancel hit (![[HitIcon.png]])) results.  

• When a player cancels a hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result, that die is removed  
from the attack pool.
