[[Activating Units]], [[Command Cards]], [[Command Phase]],
[[Commander]], [[Issuing Orders]], [[Order Pool]], [[Rank]]

Each unit has an order token that  
matches both its faction and its rank.
Players use these order tokens to activate their units.  
• One side of an order token depicts the unit’s faction:  
Galactic Empire or Rebel Alliance. The other side of the  
order token depicts the unit’s rank: commander (󲉴),  
operative (󲊆), corps (�), special forces (󲉳), support (󲊅),  
or heavy (󲉲). A token with its rank side showing is faceup.  
• During the Command Phase, when a player issues orders  
to a unit by playing a command card, that player places an  
order token displaying that unit’s rank on the battlefield next  
to that unit; the player places the order token so its rank side  
is faceup.  
• After issuing orders to units during the Command Phase, a  
player places any order tokens not on the battlefield into that  
player’s order pool.
• During the Activation Phase, a player either activates a  
friendly unit with a faceup order token or takes a random  
order token from their order pool and activates a friendly  
unit with a matching rank that does not have an order token.  
• After a player activates their unit, they place that unit’s  
order token near that unit on the battlefield so its rank side  
is facedown and its faction side is faceup. This facedown  
order token indicates that the unit has activated during this  
game round.  
• When a unit is defeated, its order token is removed from the  
game, either when an order token is drawn from the pool  
that does not match the rank of any unactivated unit on the  
battlefield, or in the End Phase.
