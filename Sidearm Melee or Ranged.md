[[Attack Pool]], [[Ranged Weapon]], [[Melee Weapon]]

If an upgrade that adds a miniature to a unit has the sidearm:  
melee keyword or the sidearm: ranged keyword, the mini  
added by that upgrade cannot use any weapons during a melee  
or ranged attack, respectively, other than the weapon on the  
upgrade card that added that mini.  

_For example, the Electrostaff Guard upgrade card has a melee  
weapon and the sidearm: melee keyword. The mini added  
by that upgrade can only use the weapon on the Electrostaff  
Guard upgrade during a melee attack. That mini may still use  
any available ranged weapon, such as the ranged weapon on the  
Imperial Royal Guard unit card, during a ranged attack._
