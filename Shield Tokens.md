Certain units have shield tokens that  
allow them to cancel hit (󲉠) results  
or even critical (󲉡) results. Shield  
tokens are double-sided, with an  
active side and an inactive side.  
• Shield tokens always enter play  
with their active side faceup.  
• Shield tokens are placed on the battlefield next to the unit  
that has those shield tokens.  
• Shield tokens belong to the unit, and are not assigned to  
individual minis.  
• When a unit flips an active shield token, that shield token is  
flipped to its inactive side and is now inactive. When a unit  
flips an inactive shield token, that shield token is flipped to  
its active side and is now active.
• While defending against a ranged attack, during the “Apply  
Dodge and Cover ” step of the attack, a unit can flip any  
number of its active shield tokens to their inactive side to  
cancel 1 hit (󲉠) or critical (󲉡) result for each shield token  
flipped in this way.  
» Shield tokens can be used this way only during ranged  
attacks, not melee attacks.  
• If an attack pool as the ion x keyword, During the Apply  
Dodge and Cover step of the attack, the defender must  
apply any other effects (such as dodge tokens and cover)  
before flipping active shield tokens. Then, for each hit (󲉠) or  
critical (󲉡) result remaining up to x, where x is the value of  
the ion x keyword, the defender must flip an active shield  
token to its inactive side. Shield tokens flipped in this way  
do not cancel a hit (󲉠) or critical (󲉡) result. After doing  
so, if any active shield tokens remain, the defender may flip  
them to cancel hit (󲉠) or critical (󲉡) results as normal.
• Certain game effects allow a unit to flip inactive shield  
tokens. When doing so, flip shield tokens from their inactive  
side to their active side.
