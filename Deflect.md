[[Attack]], [[Cancel]], [[Dice]], [[Dodge]], [[Surges]], [[Wounds]]

The deflect keyword allows a unit to gain additional benefits  
from spending dodge tokens. 

• While a unit that has the deflect keyword is defending, if  
it spends a dodge token, any defense surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]) results are  
converted to block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results; additionally, if the attack  
is ranged, the attacker suffers one wound for each defense  
surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]) result rolled by the defender during the “Roll  
Defense Dice” step.  

• The defender must spend a dodge token to gain the benefits  
of the deflect keyword. Spending this dodge token cancels  
one hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result, as normal. The defender may spend  
additional dodge tokens to cancel additional hits; however,  
doing so does not improve or add to the benefits of the  
deflect keyword.  

• If the defender uses the deflect keyword during an  
attack, it is possible for the attacker to be defeated during  
the “Roll Defense Dice” step. If the deflect keyword  
inflicts a number of wounds that causes the attacker to be  
defeated, the attack still continues and the defender can still  
suffer wounds.
