[[Base Contact]], [[Free Actions]], [[Melee]], [[Movement]]

After a unit that has the **charge** keyword performs a move  
action into base contact to start a melee with an enemy unit, it  
may perform a free melee attack action against that unit.

• This attack action is a free action and therefore does not  
count as one of the unit’s two actions.  

• A unit that has already performed an attack action during its  
activation cannot perform a free attack action.  

• A unit that has already performed a free attack action  
during its activation cannot perform another attack action.
