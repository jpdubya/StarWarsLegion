[[Command Phase]], [[Issuing Orders]]

A unit with the direct keyword often works alongside other  
subordinate units of a specific type. The direct keyword itself  
always specifically states the unit name, rank, or type of this  
other unit. Each Command Phase, during the Issue Orders  
step, a unit with the direct keyword may issue an order to a  
friendly unit at range 1–2 that meets the unit specifications of  
that direct keyword.  

• Orders issued with the direct keyword are considered to be  
issued by the unit that has the direct keyword. 

• Game effects that trigger when a unit is issued an order,  
such as those on command cards, trigger when a unit is  
issued an order by the direct keyword.  

• Game effects that alter the range at which a unit issues  
orders or can be issued orders, such as those on upgrade  
cards, can effect the range of the direct keyword.  

• When issuing an order via the direct keyword, the order  
==must== be issued to a unit that meets the specifications of that  
direct keyword, however other game effects that trigger  
==when== a unit is issued an order may cause the order to be  
issued to a different unit instead.
