The most common type of terrain on the battlefield, area terrain,  
includes woods, tall grass, rivers, and the ruined shells of blown-  
out buildings.  

Area terrain is unique in that it represents a zone of terrain, rather  
than individual objects or pieces of terrain. When determining  
the size of area terrain, imagine a zone beginning at the bottom  
edges of the terrain and extending straight upward to a point  
parallel with the highest physical feature of the terrain. This  
creates a three dimensional, often cylindrical, zone that is effected  
by the area terrain. Any attacks made that fire through or into this  
zone, even if line of sight is not physically blocked by a feature of  
this terrain, are subject to the effects of the area terrain.  
It is easy to determine the boundaries of area terrain if it is  
mounted on a base of its own, dotted with decorative terrain  
elements (such as trees) that can be removed to accommodate the  
movement and placement of minis.

Some battlefields are more complex and this type of terrain is  
built into the battlefield itself. If players wish to delineate an area  
of terrain that does not have a clear boundary, they may choose  
a number of terrain pieces and draw an imaginary line around  
the outer geometry of those pieces to determine the outer edges  
of the terrain.  

When an attacker is checking line of sight, ground vehicles  
and emplacement troopers are treated as area terrain, and can  
provide cover in this way. When determining cover provided by  
one of these units, treat the unit's base as the outer edge of the  
terrain and the highest point of the unit's mini as the top of the  
zone that provides cover. Generally, creatures, emplacements  
and walking vehicles with legs provide light cover, while  
wheeled or treaded vehicles provide heavy cover.
