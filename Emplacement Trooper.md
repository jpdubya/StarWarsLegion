[[Movement]], [[Troopers]]

An emplacement trooper is a type of unit. It is a subtype of the  
trooper unit type.  

• Any game effect that targets or applies to troopers can target  
or apply to emplacement troopers.  

• Emplacement trooper units follow the same rules as trooper  
units with the following exceptions:  

» Emplacement troopers are affixed to either a medium,  
large, or huge notched base.  

» When an emplacement trooper performs a standard  
move, the player inserts the movement tool into the  
front notch of the mini’s base.  

» Emplacement troopers can obscure other minis, and  
provide [[light cover]] when doing so.  

» Emplacement troopers ==cannot== [[climb and clamber]]. 

» Emplacement troopers can [[pivot]] and [[reverse]].  

» Emplacement troopers cannot use the **[[claim]]** or  
**[[sabotage or repair]]** abilities.

» Emplacement troopers cannot be [[displaced]]. 

» [[Ground vehicles]] cannot move through  
emplacement troopers.

» Another unit cannot end a [[compulsory move]]  
overlapping an emplacement trooper. 

» When an emplacement trooper [[withdraws]], it can  
perform free actions and use abilities. It must still spend  
all available actions and performs a speed-1 move.
