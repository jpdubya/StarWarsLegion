![[Area Weapon Example.png]]

A weapon with a yellow range icon ![[RangeIcon.png]] is an area weapon. When using an area weapon,  perform a separate attack against each unit that is  
in line of sight and at the range indicated by the  
number on the range icon.

• Area weapons can be used only through abilities and other  
game effects that specifically allow the use of area weapons.  

• Area weapons are usually associated with a charge or  
condition token, and are used when that charge or condition  
token detonates.  

• Attacks made by an area weapon are ranged attacks.  

• Ranged attacks made by area weapons are performed against  
each unit at range and in line of sight, even if that unit  
is engaged.  

• An area weapon cannot be in the same attack pool as  
another weapon.  

• Area weapons cannot be added to an attack pool during an  
attack made by a unit.  

• Other weapons cannot be added to an attack pool with an  
area weapon already in it, including other area weapons.
