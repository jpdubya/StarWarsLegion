[[Attack]], [[Cancel]], [[Dodge]], [[Immune Deflect]]

The lightsaber form of djem so, while seemingly a defensive  
form, is often favored by more aggressively minded Jedi. For a  
djem so master, each strike by an opponent is an opportunity  
for a parry and a devastating counter blow. While a unit with  
the djem so mastery keyword is defending, if it spends a  
dodge token, its surge conversion chart gains “![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]] : ![[BlockIcon.png]]” and if at  
least one hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) or critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) result is canceled, the attacker  
suffers one wound during the “[[Apply Dodge and Cover]]” step.  

• The defender must spend at least one dodge token and at  
least one hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) or critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) result must be canceled  
during the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step of the attack in  
order for the attacker to suffer one wound.  
» If all hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results would be canceled by cover, the  
defender can still spend a dodge token in order to gain  
the benefits of djem so mastery, including causing the  
attacker to suffer one wound.  
» If the attack pool contains only critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results at  
the start of the “Apply Dodge and Cover” step, and the  
defender is unable to cancel critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results, the  
defender can still spend a dodge token to gain “![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]] : ![[BlockIcon.png]].”  
The attacker does not suffer a wound, since no hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) or  
critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results were canceled.  
» If a unit has the outmaneuver keyword, it can spend  
dodge tokens to cancel critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results.  

• The djem so mastery keyword can be used during any type  
of attack, including both [[ranged]] and [[melee]].

• If djem so mastery is used against an attack that includes  
the immune: **[[deflect]]** keyword, it cannot cause wounds to
the attacker.

• A unit must spend a dodge token to gain the benefits of  
the djem so mastery keyword. Spending this dodge token  
cancels one hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result as normal. The unit may spend  
additional dodge tokens to cancel additional hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results;  
however, doing so does not improve or add to the benefits  
of the djem so mastery keyword and does not cause  
additional wounds to the attacker.  

• If a unit uses the djem so mastery keyword during an  
attack, it is possible for the attacker to be [[defeated]] during  
the “[[Apply Dodge and Cover]]” step. If the djem so mastery  
keyword inflicts a wound that causes the attacker to be  
defeated, the attack still continues and the defender can still  
suffer wounds.
