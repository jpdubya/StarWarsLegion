[[Actions]], [[Activating Units]], [[Activation Phase]],  
[[Ion X]] (Weapon Keyword), [[Vehicles]]

![[Pasted image 20220120203011.png]]

At the start of a unit’s activation, if that unit has one  
or more ion tokens, it loses one action for each ion  
token. At the end of a unit’s activation, it removes  
any ion tokens that it has.  

• A vehicle or droid trooper unit that suffers  
wounds after defending against an attack  
that includes a weapon with the **[[ion x]]** keyword gains x  
ion tokens.  

• Even if it loses both of its actions due to ion tokens, a  
unit can still perform free actions granted by abilities or  
upgrade cards.
