[Courage], [[Movement]], [[Suppression]], [[Panic]]

A unit with the **compel** keyword can force another unit to  
keep moving, even when it would normally be hindered by  
suppression. After a trooper unit at range 1–2 of a friendly  
unit with the compel keyword performs its “Rally” step, if that  
trooper unit is suppressed but is not panicked, it may gain 1  
suppression token to perform a free move action.  


• Since it has already performed its “Rally” step, a unit gaining  
a suppression token from the **compel** ability will not  
become panicked if gaining that suppression token causes it  
to have suppression tokens equal to or exceeding double its  
courage value.  


• A unit with the **compel** keyword cannot use its own  
**compel** ability on itself.
