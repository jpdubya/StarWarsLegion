[[Abilities]], [[Unit Leader]], [[Wounds]]

Some characters are faithful companions or subservient  
minions, and are almost never seen apart from another  
character. A character like this will have the **counterpart**  
keyword and the mini that represents that character is always  
added to another character’s unit. That character’s card is a  
counterpart card and their mini is a counterpart mini.  
A counterpart mini cannot be fielded as its own unit; it is  
instead added to another unit, specified by the **counterpart**  
keyword. A counterpart and its corresponding unit combine  
to form one unit, consisting of the counterpart and non-  
counterpart minis and represented by the combination of the  
unit card and the counterpart card.  


• The non-counterpart mini is always the unit leader.  


• The combined unit has the rank, defense die color, courage  
value, surge conversion chart, and maximum speed shown  
on the unit card.  

» Any non-counterpart minis have the health value shown  
on the unit card.  

» Any counterpart minis have the health value shown on  
the counterpart card.

• The combined unit has the keywords of both the unit card  
and the counterpart card.  

» If all counterpart minis are defeated, the combined unit  
loses the keywords of the counterpart card. 


• Only non-counterpart minis can use weapons shown on the  
unit card, while only counterpart minis can use weapons  
shown on the counterpart card.  

» If the combined unit gains a weapon from command  
card effect, only the non-counterpart mini can use
that weapon.


• The combined unit has the unit type shown on the unit card. 

» The counterpart card may have a different unit type or  
subtype; this is only used for the purposes of equipping  
upgrade cards.  


• While building an army, players must follow any rules or  
restrictions when equipping upgrade cards to counterparts.  

» During a game, any non-weapon upgrade cards  
equipped to a counterpart are usable by the combined  
unit, unless all counterpart minis are defeated.  

» Upgrade cards with weapons can be used only by the  
counterpart or non-counterpart minis to which they are  
equipped, respectively.


• When the combined unit suffers wounds, any mini can be  
assigned any number of those wounds, as decided by the  
player that controls that unit, regardless of whether the  
attacking unit has line of sight to that mini.  

» A counterpart mini must be defeated before a  
non-counterpart mini.
