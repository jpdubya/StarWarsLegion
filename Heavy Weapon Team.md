[[Unit Leader]], [[Upgrade Cards]]

A unit with the heavy weapon team keyword must equip a  
heavy weapon upgrade card. The heavy weapon mini added to  
the unit by that upgrade card is the unit leader.  

â€¢ If the unit leader of a unit with the heavy weapon team  
keyword is defeated, replace one of the remaining minis  
with a heavy weapon mini from an equipped heavy weapon  
upgrade card.
