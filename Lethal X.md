[[Aim]], [[Attack]], [[Pierce X]]

Certain weapons are particularly deadly when carefully aimed.  
While a unit performs an attack with a weapon that has the  
lethal x keyword, it can spend up to x aim tokens during the  
Modify Attack Dice step. If it does, the attack pool gains **[[pierce  1]]**
for each aim token spent.  

â€¢ The attacking unit does not gain the usual benefits of  
spending an aim token if it spends it on the lethal x  
keyword.
