[[Courage]], [[Movement]], [[Suppression]], [[Panic]]

A unit with the dauntless keyword can keep moving  
while under fire, even when it would normally be hindered  
by suppression. After a unit with the dauntless keyword  
performs its [[Rally]] step, if it is suppressed but is not panicked,  
it may gain 1 suppression token to perform a free move action.  

â€¢ Since it has already performed its Rally step, a unit gaining  
a suppression token from the dauntless ability will not  
become panicked if gaining that suppression token causes it  
to have suppression tokens equal to or exceeding double its  
courage value.
