A vehicle unit can become disabled when it has  
wound tokens equal to or exceeding its resilience  
value (see "Resilience" on page 69).  

• When a vehicle unit is disabled, it gains a  
disabled token. The token is placed on the  
battlefield near the unit leader and remains  
with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.

• A unit that is disabled cannot reverse and must spend two  
actions to perform a standard move or strafe.  
» A disabled unit can still perform a pivot action by  
spending one action during its activation.  

• A disabled token is one of three different types of vehicle  
damage tokens.
