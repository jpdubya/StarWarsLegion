[[Cover]], [[Creature Trooper]], [[Difficult Terrain]]

From hastily constructed barriers made of rubble to the  
permanent defenses at an Imperial facility, barricades represent  
terrain that has been specifically built for use by troopers. 

• A barricade provides emplacement troopers with cover.  

• A barricade does not provide creature troopers with cover.  

• Typically, barricades do not provide vehicles with cover. However, barricades **can** provide cover to vehicles if, when declaring terrain during Set Up, the barricade  
obscures half or more of that vehicle.

_For example, barricades can provide heavy cover to  
both standing and ball-form droidekas minis, the X-34  
Landspeeder, and the TX-225 GAVw Occupier._

• All units can move over a barricade.  
» A barricade is difficult terrain for most trooper units; typically, if a barricade provides cover to a unit, it will also be difficult terrain for that unit.  
» A barricade is difficult terrain for some smaller vehicles; typically, if a barricade provides cover to a unit, it will also be difficult terrain for that unit.

Barricades are generally high enough for trooper minis to take  
cover behind, but low enough for them to shoot over. This type  
of terrain is often found in multiple small segments that can be  
combined to form defensive lines.
