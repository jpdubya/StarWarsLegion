Base contact refers to a miniature’s base physically touching  
something on the battlefield, typically a piece of terrain, another  
mini, or an objective token.  

• If the bases of two minis are touching each other, those  
minis are in base contact.  

• If a mini’s base is touching a piece of terrain or an objective  
token, that mini is in base contact with that terrain or token. 

• Friendly minis from different units can be in base contact  
with each other.  

• Minis cannot be in base contact with minis from enemy  
units, unless the unit leader has a melee weapon (![[MeleeIcon.png]]), in  
which case the unit leader can perform a move into base  
contact with a mini from an enemy unit to start a melee.  

• Because a mini’s base can overhang a ledge or be placed  
askew on top of uneven terrain, there are sometimes  
situations in which an another mini cannot be placed into  
physical base contact with the first mini because of a slight  
difference in elevation between the two bases. In these  
situations, if two conditions are met, those minis are treated  
as if they are in base contact. These conditions are as follows: 
[[#Conditions]]


• If a player is attempting to move a mini into base contact  
with another mini and those minis are blocked from being  
placed in base contact by the non-base portion of either  
mini, the payer that is moving the mini may alter that mini’s  
final position, within an acceptable margin, such that the  
minis are placed in base contact. For further rules, see  
"Margin of Error" on page 11

• Units cannot be placed into or move into base contact with  
an enemy mini during Setup.  



# Conditions
» First, when viewed from above, there is no space  
between the two minis bases, such that if they were not  
on differing elevations or they were both flat on the  
battlefield, their bases would be touching.  

» Second, the vertical space separating the two bases  
is less than the thickness of a standard STAR WARS:  
LEGION base.  

» If these two conditions are met, minis in this situation  
are considered to be in base contact and follow all the  
normal rules for being in base contact.
