[[Attack]], [[Fire Support]] (Unit Keyword), [[Range]]

A weapon with the **beam x** keyword fires a continuous beam of  
energy, sweeping across swaths of enemies and dealing massive  
damage. During the Declare Additional Defenders step of  
an attack, if a weapon with the **beam x** keyword is in a unit's  
attack pool, that unit may declare up to x additional attacks  
using only the weapon with the **beam x** keyword.  
Each additional attack must be declared against a different  
defender that is at range 1 of the last defender declared.  

• Each unit that is declared as a defender against one of the  
additional attacks can be beyond the maximum range of the  
weapon with **beam x**, as long that defender is at range 1 of  
the previously declared defender.  

• Each additional defender must be in line of sight of  
the attacker.  

• Other friendly units cannot use the **[[fire support]]** keyword  
during the additional attacks made with **beam x**.  

• Additional defenders are declared by repeating steps 1 and  
2 of the attack sequence. Additional defenders are declared  
one at a time.  

» All defenders are declared before any attacks  
are resolved.
