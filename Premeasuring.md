[[Attack]], [[Issuing Orders]], [[Movement]], [[Range]]

Players can measure with the range ruler, movement tools,  
and silhouette template (if playing with tournament rules) at  
any time.  

• A player can measure with only 1 movement tool and 1  
range ruler at the same time.

• Premeasuring does not commit a player to performing any  
actions. However, if a mini is picked up or moved it must  
complete that movement.
