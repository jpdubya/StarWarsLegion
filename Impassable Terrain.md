Impassable terrain represents buildings, high walls, wrecked  
vehicles, deep chasms, and other major impediments.  
What is considered impassable terrain varies from mini to mini.  
Trooper minis treat anything higher than the height of their  
mini to be impassable terrain, while vehicles treat anything  
higher than half the height of their mini as impassable terrain. A  
unit cannot perform a standard move or a reverse during which  
it would overlap impassable terrain.  
While units cannot move through impassible terrain, trooper  
units can often climb or clamber onto it, provided there is  
a flat surface to place them on, and some units often ignore  
impassable terrain of a certain hight entirely, due to specific  
keywords, allowing them to be placed on top of the terrain or  
move past it.

Impassable terrain represents buildings, high walls, wrecked  
vehicles, deep chasms, and other major impediments. 

• Units cannot move through impassable terrain.  

• Whether or not a piece of terrain is impassable depends on a  
unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle). See  
"Additional Terrain Rules" on page 8.  
» When using custom terrain, it is important to define  
the difficulty of that terrain as it relates to each unit type  
prior to the beginning of the game.
