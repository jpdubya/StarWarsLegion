[[Command Cards]], [[Command Phase]]

Not every hero is faultless and not every villain is  
unwavering. Some characters have critical flaws that come  
to light at the most inopportune times. Each unit that has  
the flawed keyword has a corresponding flaw card. During  
setup, that unit’s flaw card ==must== be added to an opponent’s  
command hand.  

During the game, that opponent may play the flaw card  
according to the rules described on the card itself. During  
the End Phase, any flaw cards in play are discarded and their  
effects end.  

• A unit’s specific flaw card is identified by that unit’s name  
appearing in the upper right of the flaw cad itself. 

• Flaw cards can be played only according to the rules on the  
flaw card itself. Most flaw cards are played at the start of the  
Command Phase.  

• Flaw cards are not command cards. 

• Flaw cards are placed in an opponent’s command hand for  
the sake of convenience. Effects that target an opponent’s  
command hand or command cards ==cannot== target or effect a  
flaw card.

• If both players have a flaw card in their hand, at the start of  
each phase the blue player must decide whether or not to  
play a flaw card before the red player decides.  

• When a flaw card is discarded from play, it is placed in the  
discard pile of the player that controls the associated unit.  
This is to avoid the card being misplaced after a game.
