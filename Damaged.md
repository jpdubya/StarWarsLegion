[[Actions]], [[Activating Units]], [[Dice]], [[Resilience]],  
[[Vehicles]], [[Wounds]]

A vehicle unit can become damaged when it has  
wound tokens equal to or exceeding its [[resilience]]  
value.  

• When a vehicle unit is damaged, it gains a  
damaged token. The token is placed on the  
battlefield near the unit leader and remains  
with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.  

• When a player activates a damaged unit, before it performs  
any actions, it rolls a white defense die. If the result is a  
blank, that vehicle performs one fewer action during its  
activation.  
» A unit that loses an action in this way can still perform  
any number of free actions.  

• A damaged token is one of three different types of vehicle  
damage tokens.
