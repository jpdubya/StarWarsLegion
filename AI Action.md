[[Actions]], [[Command Phase]], [[Order Tokens]]

The **ai: action** keyword requires a unit to perform a specific  
preprogrammed action if it does not have a faceup order token.  

• During the Perform Actions step of a unit's activation, a  
unit with the **ai: action** keyword must perform one of the  
actions listed after **ai** as its first action.  

» This applies only during a unit’s activation, and has no  
	effect on moves, attacks, or actions granted outside of a  
	unit’s activation.  
	
» If a unit has multiple actions listed after **ai**, it may choose  
	which one to perform.  
	
» If a unit cannot perform one of its listed actions as its  
	first action, it is free to perform actions as normal.
