When a unit with the defend x keyword is issued an order, it  
gains x dodge tokens.  

• If a unit with the defend x keyword would be issued an  
order but a game effect causes that order not to be issued or  
to be issued to another unit instead, that unit cannot use the  
defend x keyword.  

• This effect is different than performing a dodge action, and  
therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after dodge  
actions are performed.
