During the Command Phase, each player selects a command  
card from their hand and chooses a commander to issue orders  
to one or more units on the battlefield.  

To resolve the Command Phase, players perform the following  
steps in order:  

1. **Select Command Card**: Each player secretly selects a  
command card from their hand and places it facedown on the  
table. Then, both players simultaneously reveal their cards.  

» If a player does not have a commander or an operative  
on the battlefield, they do not select or resolve a  
command card.  

» A player must select a command card if able.  

2. **Determine Priority**: The player whose card has the ==fewest==  
number of pips has priority.  

» If both cards have the same number of pips, the player  
who has the round counter rolls a red defense die  
(six-sided red die). If the result of the roll is a block  
(![[BlockIcon.png]]), that player has priority. Otherwise, their opponent  
has priority.  

» If one player plays a command card and their opponent  
does not, the player who played a card has priority.  

3. **Issue Orders**: Starting with the player who has priority, each  
player nominates a friendly eligible commander or operative  
and issues orders with that unit. The number of orders to  
be issued is indicated on the orders section of the chosen  
command card.

4. **Create Order Pool**: Each player creates an order pool that  
consists of all of their order tokens that they did not place  
on the battlefield while resolving their command card.  

» It is recommended that players place their order tokens  
in an opaque bag; however, players can also create their  
order pool by placing each order token facedown near  
the battlefield and then shuffling those tokens.  


• After players resolve these four steps, play proceeds to the  
Activation Phase.  


# Issue Orders
» If a commander-specific or operative-specific  
command card is played, the player must nominate that  
commander or operative. 

» If a non-operative-specific command card is played, the  
player cannot nominate an operative to issue orders.  
» For a commander or operative to issue an order  
to a unit, that unit must be eligible to receive that  
order. To be eligible, a unit must meet all of the  
following requirements:  

- The unit cannot have already received an order  
during the current Command Phase.  

- The unit must be at range 1–3 of the nominated  
commander or operative.  

- If a unit type (e.g., trooper) is specified on the chosen  
command card, the unit being issued an order must  
be of the specified type.
