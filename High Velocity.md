[[Attack]], [[Dodge]], [[Weapons]]

During an attack that includes a weapon with the high velocity  
keyword, if the only weapons in the attack pool are weapons with  
the high velocity keyword, the defender cannot spend dodge  
tokens during the [[Apply Dodge and Cover]] step.  

• If the attacking unit has formed multiple attack pools for  
different defenders, the high velocity keyword only  
applies to the attack pool that the weapon with the keyword  
was added to, and only if all weapons in that attack pool
have the high velocity keyword.

• A defending unit that cannot spend dodge tokens cannot  
use the deflect ability.
