Melee represents close combat between opposing units. When  
two miniatures from opposing players’ units are in base contact,  
those units are in a melee.  

• If two trooper units are in a melee, those units are engaged.  
Any unit type can be in a melee, but only troopers can  
be engaged.  

• When a unit performs an attack against a unit that it  
is in a melee with, that attack is a melee attack. Melee  
attacks follow the same rules as ranged attacks with the  
following exceptions:  
» The attacker can use only weapons that have the melee  
(![[MeleeIcon.png]]) icon.  
» The target of the attack must be in the same melee as  
the attacker.

• If a unit has a melee weapon, it can start a melee by moving  
into base contact with an enemy miniature. To start a melee, a  
player must follow these steps in order: 

1. **Move Unit Leader**: The player performs a move, moving  
their unit leader into base contact with an enemy mini.  
2. **Move Other Minis**: Maintaining cohesion, the player places  
each other mini in the unit that started the melee into base  
contact with enemy minis that belong to the same enemy unit  
that their unit leader is now in melee with.  
3. **Opponent Moves Minis**: Maintaining cohesion, the player’s  
opponent moves any of their own minis that belong to the  
unit that is now in a melee (that are not already in base  
contact with an enemy mini) into base contact with minis  
from the unit that started the melee.
» If the opponent’s unit does not have a melee weapon, the  
opponent does not move their minis into base contact  
with the unit that started the melee.  

• A unit cannot move in such a way that its minis would be  
placed in base contact with multiple enemy units.  
» It is possible for a unit to be in a melee with multiple  
enemy units if another unit joins later.

• A unit that does not have a melee weapon cannot start  
a melee.  

• When moving minis into base contact with enemy minis  
after a melee has been started, if there is not space to place a  
mini in base contact with an enemy mini in the same melee,  
that mini must still be placed in cohesion.  

• Minis that are not in base contact with an enemy mini can  
still contribute to a melee attack if the unit to which that  
mini belongs is in a melee.

• Whenever there are minis that are not in base contact with  
an enemy mini but those minis have a melee weapon and  
the unit to which they belong is in a melee, those minis must  
be placed in base contact with an enemy mini in the same  
melee as their unit if possible. This can happen when minis  
in a melee suffer wounds and are defeated, creating space for  
other minis that were not previously in base contact to be  
placed in base contact.  
» If both players own minis that are not in base contact  
with an enemy mini and should be, the player that is  
currently activating a unit or has most recently activated  
a unit (even if that unit is not the unit with minis that  
should be placed in base contact with enemy minis)  
should move their minis into base contact with enemy  
minis before the other player does so. If neither play has  
activated a unit yet this round, the blue player should  
move their minis first.
» Minis that are no longer in base contact should always be  
placed back into base contact with an enemy mini if able,  
even if each enemy mini that was in base contact has  
just been defeated. This can happen when the defending  
unit does not have a melee weapon and not all defending  
minis were in base contact with an enemy mini.

_For example, Luke Skywalker is in base contact with an  
enemy 74-Z Speeder Bike mini, while another mini from  
the same unit is not in base contact with Luke Skywalker.  
After performing an attack, Luke Skywalker defeats the  
enemy 74-Z Speeder Bike mini and is no longer is base  
contact with an enemy mini. Because there is another 74-Z  
Speeder Bike mini from that unit, Luke Skywalker should  
immediately be placed into base contact with that mini._  

» If for any reason minis cannot be placed back into base  
contact with an enemy mini and none of the minis  
belonging to that unit are in base contact with an enemy  
mini, those minis stay where they are on the battlefield  
and that unit is no longer in melee.
