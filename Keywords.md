[[Abilities]], [[Attack]], [[Attack Pool]], [[Unit]], [[Weapons]]

A keyword is an ability possessed by units or weapons. 

• There are two types of keywords: unit keywords and  
weapon keywords.  
» A unit keyword is an inherent ability of a unit and it  
is presented on a unit’s card or added to a unit by an  
upgrade card.  
» A weapon keyword is an inherent ability of a weapon  
and is presented as part of a weapon on either a unit’s  
card or an upgrade card.  

• Each unit keyword provides a unit with an ability, including  
the timing of when the ability is used as well as the effect of  
the ability.

• Each weapon keyword adds an ability to the attack pool in  
which it is included.  

• All keywords with a numerical value (an “x” value) are  
cumulative with themselves. This includes both weapon  
keywords and unit keywords (including unit keywords that  
are card actions, such as the **[[jump x]]** keyword).  

_For example, an AT-ST has the ==arsenal 2== keyword; if that  
AT-ST uses the free card action on the General Weiss upgrade  
card to gain ==arsenal 2==, that AT-ST now has ==arsenal 4==.  
Similarly, when a Stormtrooper unit composed of four minis  
performs an attack, if each mini chooses to use the weapon  
on an equipped Impact Grenades upgrade card, the attack  
pool would consist of ==four instances of impact 1==, and thus the  
attack pool would have ==impact 4==._

• The front of each unit card provides reminder text of each  
of that unit’s keywords. The back of each unit card provides  
reminder text for each of that unit’s weapon keywords.
» The reminder text is not an exhaustive description of  
the rules for a keyword. Rather, it is there to help players  
remember how and when to resolve each keyword. If a  
player has questions about how a keyword works, that  
player should refer to that keyword’s glossary entry.
