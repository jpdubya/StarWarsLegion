[[Attack]], [[Guardian X]] (Unit Keyword), [[Immune Deflect]] (Unit Keyword)

Those who have mastered the Soresu style of lightsaber combat  
have perfected the defensive arts. While a unit with soresu  
mastery is defending or using the guardian x keyword, if it  
spends a dodge token, its surge conversion chart gains “![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]] : ![[BlockIcon.png]],”  
and the attacker suffers 1 wound for each defense surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]])  
result rolled during the “Roll Defense Dice” step.  

• While using the [[guardian x]] keyword, a unit with the  
Soresu mastery keyword can spend 1 dodge token at the  
start of the “Modify Attack Dice” step of an attack to cancel
1 hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result.  
» This canceled hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result counts as one of the x hit (![[HitIcon.png]])  
results canceled with guardian x.  
» If the unit with soresu mastery spends a dodge token  
in this way, it will roll 1 fewer defense die while using  
guardian x.  
» Soresu mastery cannot be used to spend a dodge token  
while using guardian x if the attack pool contains only  
weapons with the [[high velocity]] keyword.  
» While using the guardian x keyword, a unit with the  
Soresu mastery keyword can spend only 1 dodge token.
• If soresu mastery is used against an attack that includes  
the [[Immune Deflect]] keyword, it cannot cause wounds to  
the attacker.  
• A unit must spend a dodge token to gain the benefits of  
the soresu mastery keyword. Spending this dodge token  
cancels one hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result. If the unit is defending, it may  
spend additional dodge tokens to cancel additional hit (![[HitIcon.png]])  
results; however, doing so does not improve or add to the  
benefits of the soresu mastery keyword.  
• If a unit uses the soresu mastery keyword during an  
attack, it is possible for the attacker to be defeated during the  
“Roll Defense Dice” step. If the soresu mastery keyword  
inflicts a number of wounds that causes the attacker to be  
defeated, the attack still continues and the defender can still  
suffer wounds.
