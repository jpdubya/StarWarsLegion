[[Command Cards]], [[Command Phase]],  
[[Commander]], [[Issuing Orders]], [[Order Tokens]], [[Rank]], [[Unit]]

The ![[OperativeIcon.png]] icon indicates that a unit has the rank  
of operative. Operatives are powerful villains  
and heroes, but they rarely issue orders to other  
units. When building a standard army, a player  
may include up to two operative units.  
• Each operative has several command cards specific to that  
operative that can only be used if that operative is included  
in an army.  
» Operative-specific command cards are identified by the  
name of that operative appearing below the name of the  
command card.
• When playing an operative’s command card, the player does  
not nominate a commander; instead they nominate the  
operative, and that operative issues orders.  
• When playing a non-operative-specific command card, a  
player cannot nominate an operative.  
• Any units indicated on an operative’s command card can be  
issued orders only if they are at range 1–3 of the nominated  
operative. A nominated operative is at range 1–3 of itself.  
• If all of a players commanders have been defeated, an  
operative can be promoted to be a new commander. If  
promoted in this way, it loses the rank of operative and  
can be nominated as a commander and can issue orders  
using non-operative-specific command cards during the  
Command Phase.
• When an operative is defeated, their operative-specific  
command cards are not discarded from the player's command  
hand, even though they can no longer be played.  
• When a friendly unit is checking whether it is panicked, it  
cannot use an operative's courage value.
