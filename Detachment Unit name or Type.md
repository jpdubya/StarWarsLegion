[[Army building]], [[Cohesion Deployment]], [[Setup]]

A unit with the detachment keyword is subject to a number of  
restrictions during army building and setup.  

• During army building, a unit with the detachment  
keyword can only be included in a player’s army if a unit  
that has the unit name or type specified by the detachment  
keyword is also included in that army.  
» Each unit with the detachment keyword requires a  
corresponding unit with the specified unit name or type  
in order to be included in an army.

_For example, a player wishes to add a DF-90 Mortar  
Trooper to their army. Because the DF-90 Mortar Trooper  
has the detachment: Shoretroopers keyword, the player
must first add a unit of Shoretroopers to their army. The  
player does so, and the army now contains a Shoretroopers  
unit and a DF-90 Mortar Trooper unit. The player then  
wishes to add a second DF-90 Mortar Trooper unit to  
their army, and therefore must select a second unit of  
Shoretroopers to include in their army._

• During the “Deploy Units” step of Setup, a unit with  
the detachment keyword must be placed at speed-1  
and within height 1 of a unit leader from a friendly  
unit that has the unit name or type specified by the  
detachment keyword.  
» When deploying multiple units with the same  
detachment keyword, each unit must be deployed  
at speed-1 and within height 1 of a different friendly  
unit leader. Once a unit has been used to fulfill the  
deployment requirements of a friendly unit with the  
detachment keyword, it cannot do so again for another  
friendly unit with the same detachment keyword.  
» This restriction is only required during the “Deploy  
Units” step. If a game effect (such as the Rapid  
Reinforcements battle card) allows a unit to be placed  
outside of this step, it does not follow the detachment  
keyword rules.  
» If a unit with the detachment keyword cannot be  
deployed following the detachment rules it is deployed  
as normal in a player’s deployment zone. However, if a  
player has a unit with the name or type specified by the  
detachment keyword that has not yet been deployed,  
that unit must be deployed before a unit with the
detachment keyword is deployed, such that the unit  
with the detachment keyword is able to be deployed  
following the detachment rules.  
» When a unit deploys using the detachment  
keyword, it does not have to be deployed within its  
deployment zone.
