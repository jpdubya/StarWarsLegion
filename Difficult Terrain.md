Difficult terrain is anything that impedes but does not  
completely block movement, such as craters, rubble, or woods.  
Troopers moving over barricades or up a steep but low hill also  
suffer the effects of difficult terrain.  
A unit that begins a move, moves through, or ends a move  
with any of its minis in difficult terrain has its maximum speed  
reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.  
The effect of difficult terrain is not cumulative with itself. A unit  
cannot reduce its maximum speed below 1 by moving though  
multiple pieces of difficult terrain.
