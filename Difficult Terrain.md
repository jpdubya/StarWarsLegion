Difficult terrain is anything that impedes but does not  
completely block movement.  

• While performing a standard move, a unit that begins  
its move with any of its minis in difficult terrain has its  
maximum speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.  

• While performing a standard move, a unit that would move  
through or enter difficult terrain with any of its minis has its  
maximum speed reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1.  
» A unit that moves into base contact with difficult terrain  
but does not move through it or enter it does not suffer  
this speed reduction.  

_For example, a unit of Stormtroopers whose unit leader  
moves into base contact with a barricade does not reduce  
its speed._

• The effect of difficult terrain is not cumulative with itself.  
A unit cannot reduce its maximum speed below 1 by  
moving though multiple pieces of difficult terrain. However,  
the effect of difficult terrain can be combined with other  
effects that reduce a unit’s maximum speed to cause a unit’s  
maximum speed to be less than 1.  

• When an effect causes a unit to perform a speed-x move,  
that move is not affected by difficult terrain.  

• Difficult terrain affects vehicles, including when performing  
a reverse, strafe, or compulsory move.  

• A unit can pivot, climb, or clamber while in difficult terrain  
without suffering any additional penalties.  

• When a unit performs a move, apply any effects that  
increase the unit’s maximum speed (up to speed 3), before  
applying any effects that reduce that unit’s maximum speed.  

• Whether or not a piece of terrain is difficult depends on a  
unit’s type (trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle). See  
[[Additional Terrain Rules]] 

_For example, a barricade is difficult terrain for trooper  
units, but not for vehicle units. Both ground and repulsor
vehicle units can move through barricades without incurring  
any penalties._
 
» When using custom terrain, it is important to define  
the difficulty of that terrain as it relates to each unit type  
prior to the beginning of the game.
