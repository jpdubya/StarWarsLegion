[[Activation Phase]], [[Command Phase]], [[End Phase]],
[[Priority]], [[Round]], [[Winning the Game]], [[Game Round]]

The round counter is used to track the current  
game round.  

• During the End Phase, the player who has  
the round counter rotates it to display the  
next highest number; that is the number of  
the next round. Then, that player passes the  
round counter to their opponent. 

• During the Command Phase, if both players reveal a card  
that has the same number of pips, the player who has the  
round counter rolls a red defense die. If the result of the  
roll is a block (![[BlockIcon.png]]), that player has priority. Otherwise, their  
opponent has priority.
