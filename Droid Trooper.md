[[Ion Tokens]], [[Suppression]], [[Troopers]]

A droid trooper is a type of unit. It is a subtype of the trooper  
unit type.  

• Any game effect that targets or applies to troopers can target  
or apply to droid troopers.  

• Droid trooper units follow the same rules as trooper units  
with the following exceptions:  

» A droid trooper unit does not improve its cover while it  
has one or more suppression tokens.  
» A droid trooper unit cannot be suppressed, though it  
gains suppression tokens as normal and can still panic.  
» A droid trooper unit cannot gain or resolve  
poison tokens.  
» A droid trooper unit is treated as a vehicle when gaining  
and resolving ion tokens, and when it is the target of an  
attack that includes the ion x keyword.
