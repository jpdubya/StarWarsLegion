To play a standard game of STAR WARS: LEGION, perform the  
following steps:  
1. Establish Battlefield and Gather Components: Establish a  
3' x 6' battlefield on a flat surface. The players sit across from  
each other on the 6' edges of the play area and place their  
units, cards, order tokens, movement tools, and other game  
components off the play area. Then, they assign ID tokens to  
their units, if necessary.  
2. Declare Terrain: It is important to determine what the  
terrain effects will be before the game begins. Players should  
briefly discuss each piece of terrain that is available for  
the battle and come to a consensus on its cover type and  
other characteristics.  
3. Place Terrain: Players cooperate to set up terrain in a  
mutually agreeable fashion. If they cannot or do not wish  
to, they may use the Competitive Terrain Placement rules  
found on page 9.  
4. Select Player Color and Sides: The player whose army has  
the lowest point total chooses to be either the red player  
or the blue player. Then, the red player chooses one of the  
long table edges and sets their army near that edge. The  
blue player takes the other long table edge. If both players’  
armies have the same point total, roll a die or flip a coin to  
determine which player chooses to be red or blue.  
5. Reveal Battle Cards: Using the blue player's battle deck,  
shuffle the objective, deployment, and condition cards  
separately. Then, draw and reveal four cards of each type,  
lining each type up in a horizontal row facing the blue  
player’s long table edge.  
6. Define Battlefield: Starting with the blue player, players take  
turns choosing a category and eliminating the leftmost card  
in that category (see the example below). A player may also  
forfeit their opportunity to eliminate a card if they wish to do  
so. After each player has had two opportunities to eliminate  
a card, the leftmost card remaining in each row is the card  
used during the battle. If players eliminate the first three  
cards in a category, the final card cannot be eliminated.  
7. Resolve the Objective and Condition Cards: Resolve any  
setup instructions on the objective card; then resolve any  
setup instructions on the condition card.  
8. Deploy Units: Resolve any setup instructions on the  
deployment card; some deployment cards have ongoing  
effects during this step. Then, starting with the blue player,  
players take turns placing a single unit from their army  
within their respective deployment zones. Players continue  
taking turns until all units have been deployed.  
9. Prepare Supply: Place the wound, suppression, aim, dodge,  
and other tokens near the battlefield to create the supply.  
The blue player takes the round counter and sets it to “1.”  
Then, players are ready to start the game!
