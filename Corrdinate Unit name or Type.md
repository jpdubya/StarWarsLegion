[[Issuing Orders]], [[Order Pool]]

After a unit with the **coordinate** keyword is issued an order, it  
may issue an order to a friendly unit at range 1 that has the unit  
name or type specified by the coordinate keyword. 

• Effects that trigger when a unit is issued an order trigger  
when a unit is issued an order via the coordinate keyword.


• If a unit with the coordinate keyword would be issued an  
order but a game effect causes that order not to be issued or
to be issued to another unit instead, that unit cannot use the  
coordinate keyword.

• A unit with more than one target listed after its coordinate  
keyword must choose only one of those target units when  
using the coordinate keyword.  

» When a unit that already has the coordinate keyword  
gains another instance of the coordinate keyword,  
that unit is considered to have one coordinate  
keyword with multiple target units listed.  

_For example, a unit of Shoretroopers equipped with  
Gideon Hask that is issued an order must choose whether  
it wants to use its **coordinate: emplacement trooper**  
keyword or its **coordinate: ![[CoreIcon.png]] trooper** keyword. It  
cannot use both._
