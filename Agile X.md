[[Actions]], [[Dodge]], [[Movement]]

The **agile x** keyword allows a unit to gain a number of dodge  
tokens equal to x each time that unit performs a standard  
move action.  

• Climbing, clambering, embarking, disembarking, pivoting,  
reversing, and strafing are not standard move actions. 

• The effect of the **agile x** keyword is triggered by both free  
and non-free standard move actions.  

• A compulsory move action is a standard move action. 

• This effect is different than performing a dodge action, and  
therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after dodge  
actions are performed.  

• A unit with **agile x** gains x dodge tokens only after it  
performs a standard move **action**. A unit with the **agile  
x** keyword that performs a standard move during the  
Deployment Phase (such as by using the **[[scout x]]** keyword)  
does ==not== gain x dodge tokens.
