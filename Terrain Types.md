[[Area Terrain]], [[Barricades]], [[Holes and Trenches]], [[Large Objects]]

This section details many of the most commonly available pieces  
of terrain, but it is by no means comprehensive. Therefore,  
the rules and tables herein are presented as guidelines rather  
than hard-and-fast rules. Ultimately, players should decide  
for themselves what they wish their battlefield to represent,  
adapting these rules as appropriate for their available terrain.
