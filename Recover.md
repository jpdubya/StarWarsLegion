[[Actions]], [[Exhaust]], [[Suppression]], [[Upgrade Cards]]

A unit can recover by performing a recover action. When a unit  
recovers, a player removes any number of suppression tokens  
from that unit and readies any number of the unit’s exhausted  
upgrade cards.  

• Unit abilities and other game effects can allow units to  
recover. If a game effect specifically instructs a unit to  
recover, that effect is different than performing a recover  
action and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur  
after recover actions are performed.
