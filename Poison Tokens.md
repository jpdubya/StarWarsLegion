At the end of a unit’s activation, it suffers 1 wound  
for each poison token it has, then discards each  
poison token it has.  
• If more than one effect takes place at the end of  
a unit’s activation, the player that controls that  
unit decides the order of these effects.  
• Vehicle and droid trooper units cannot gain poison tokens
