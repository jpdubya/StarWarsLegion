A weapon with a red melee icon (![[MeleeIcon 1.png]]) is a melee  
weapon. Melee weapons can only be used during  
melee attacks.  

• If a unit has multiple minis each using a melee weapon, each  
melee weapon with the same name must be added to the  
same attack pool. Melee weapons with different names may  
be added to different attack pools.

• A melee weapon cannot be in the same attack pool as a  
non-melee weapon.
