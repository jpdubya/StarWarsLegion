The Hostage Exchange objective card requires two  
hostage upgrade cards. Both hostage upgrade cards  
are identical. Hostage upgrade cards are equipped  
and unequipped to units during a game according  
to the Hostage Exchange objective card text.  
• Hostage upgrade cards can be equipped only  
via the Hostage Exchange objective card text  
and can be used only in conjunction with that  
objective card.  
• During Setup and round 1, a unit with a hostage upgrade  
card equipped gains the immune: enemy effects keyword.  
For additional rules, see "Immune: Enemy Effects (Unit  
Keyword)" on page 50
