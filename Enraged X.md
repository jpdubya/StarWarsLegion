[[Abilities]], [[Courage]], [[Suppression]], [[Wounds]]

While a unit with the enrage x keyword has wound tokens  
equal to or exceeding x, treat that unit’s courage value as “–”  
and that unit gains the **[[charge]]** keyword.  

• If a unit with enrage x has wound tokens equal to or  
exceeding x, but then removes wound tokens through other  
game effects, such that it has fewer wound tokens than x, it  
no longer benefits from the enrage x keyword.  

• While a unit’s courage value is treated as “–” it cannot gain  
suppression tokens. Remove any suppression tokens it had  
before its courage value was treated as “–”.
