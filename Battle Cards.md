[[Condition Cards]], [[Condition Tokens]], [[Defining the Battlefield]], [[Deployment]], [[Objective Cards]], [[Objective Tokens]]

Battle cards are used to define the battlefield during setup.  

• There are three types of battle cards: condition cards,  
deployment cards, and objective cards.  

• As part of the army building process, a player makes a deck  
of 12 battle cards, containing four of each type (objective,  
deployment, and condition), with no duplicates.
