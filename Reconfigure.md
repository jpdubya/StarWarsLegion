[[Dual Sided Cards]], [[Upgrade Cards]], [[Weapons]]

The reconfigure keyword allows a dual sided upgrade card  
to be flipped to another side. When a unit equipped with an  
upgrade card that has the reconfigure keyword recovers or  
performs a recover action, the player that controls that unit may  
flip that upgrade card to a different side.  

• If an upgrade card has the exhaust icon, using the  
reconfigure ability does not cause that upgrade card to be  
exhausted.  

• When a unit recovers, the player who controls that unit may  
ready and flip an upgrade card that has the reconfigure.
keyword at the same time.
