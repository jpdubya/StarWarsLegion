Height is a vertical measurement of objects on a battlefield. An  
object’s height is measured using the range ruler.  

• To measure an object’s height, a player places the end of  
the range ruler flat on the battlefield’s surface as close to  
the object as possible; the range ruler should be oriented  
vertically. The segment of the range ruler that the top of the  
object is at is equal to that object’s height.  
» If the top of the object meets the line between two range  
ruler segments without crossing that line, that object’s  
height is equal to the lower range segment that the line  
separates. Otherwise, the height of the object is equal to  
the higher range segment that the line separates.

• Some terrain may have multiple surfaces at various heights.  
When determining the height of a surface for the purposes  
of climbing or clambering, a player measures from the  
surface their miniatures are on to the surface those minis are  
climbing or clambering to.
