[[Movement]], [[Panic]], [[Pivot]]

When a unit with the reposition keyword performs a  
standard move, it may either perform a pivot before performing
that standard move or perform a pivot after performing that  
standard move.  

• A unit using the reposition keyword cannot perform a  
pivot both before and after the same standard move.  

• A pivot performed with the reposition keyword is a move.  
It is not a move action.  

• While a panicked unit with the reposition keyword  
attempts to flee the battlefield, it must use the reposition  
keyword if it will help it to flee the battlefield by the most  
expeditious route.  

• When a unit with the reposition keyword is being moved  
by an opponent, such as via the Force Push upgrade card,  
the reposition keyword can be used by the opponent  
during that move.
