[[Command Cards]], [[Commander]], [[Priority]]

Units with the cunning keyword are adept at enacting their  
own plans. During the Command Phase, if a player reveals  
a commander-specific or operative-specific command card  
that belongs to a friendly commander or operative with the  
cunning keyword, and there would be a tie for priority, treat  
that command card as though it had one fewer pip.  

â€¢ If both players reveal a commander-specific or operative-  
specific command card that belongs to a commander or  
operative with the cunning keyword, there will still be a tie  
for priority.
