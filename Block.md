[[Cancel]], [[Dice]], [[Dodge]]

While a unit that has the block keyword is defending, if it  
spends a dodge token, its surge conversion chart gains “![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]] : ![[BlockIcon.png]]”. 

• The defender must spend a dodge token to gain the benefits  
of the **block** keyword. Spending this dodge token cancels  
one hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result, as normal. The defender may spend  
additional dodge tokens to cancel additional hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results;  
however, doing so does not improve or add to the benefits of  
the **block** keyword.
