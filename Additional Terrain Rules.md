[[Cover Type]], [[Movement Difficulty]], [[Open Terrain]], [[Difficult Terrain]], [[Impassible Terrain]], [[Cover Type]]

Adding terrain to the battlefield presents unique gameplay  
challenges and opportunities. Just about anything can be used  
as terrain, from model train trees to wooden blocks and other  
toys. Many players even build their own custom terrain from  
craft supplies.  
The terrain rules in this section are designed to accommodate  
the kind of custom-built terrain found on wargaming tables.  
However, for the purposes of STAR WARS: LEGION, all that  
matters is that players agree on which terrain to use and the  
rules governing that terrain before playing the game.  
This process is quite easy, as players simply need to define the  
cover type and movement difficulty for each piece of terrain  
they have selected for the battlefield. This section includes rules  
for common terrain types, but players are free to expand or  
modify these rules as needed.
