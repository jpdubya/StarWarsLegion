[[Aim]], [[Attack]], [[Dice]]

The precise x keyword allows a unit to reroll additional dice  
when it spends an aim token.  

• During the “Reroll Attack Dice” step of an attack, when a  
unit that has the precise x keyword spends an aim token,  
that unit can reroll up to x additional attack dice.
