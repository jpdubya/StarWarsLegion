[[Deployment]], [[Range]]

Some units are masters of infiltration, and can position  
themselves on the battlefield before the fight has even begun.  
During setup, a unit with the infiltrate keyword may deploy  
anywhere on the battlefield that is beyond range 3 of each  
enemy unit.  

• If there are no enemy units on the battlefield, a unit with  
the infiltrate keyword may deploy anywhere on the  
battlefield.  

• A unit with the infiltrate keyword can deploy anywhere  
within a friendly deployment zone as normal.  

• When playing a game that uses scenario battle cards, such  
as those found in the Downed AT-ST expansion, unless  
otherwise stated, the infiltrate keyword cannot be used.  
» Scenario battle cards have a scenario icon in the top  
right corner of the card.
