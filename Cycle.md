[[Exhaust]], [[Upgrade Cards]], [[Weapons]]

At the end of a unit’s activation, ready each of its exhausted  
upgrade cards with the cycle keyword that was not used  
during that activation.  

• Only using the weapon, keywords, or other card text on  
an upgrade card counts as using that upgrade card. A mini  
added by an upgrade card is free to attack using a weapon  
printed on its unit card and still benefit from the cycle  
keyword.  

_For example, during the activation of a B2 Super Battle  
Droids unit, a B2-HA Trooper mini may use a weapon on  
the B2 Super Battle Droids unit card during an attack and  
still ready the B2-HA Trooper upgrade card with the cycle  
keyword at the end of that activation_
