Whether or not a piece of terrain provides cover varies from  
miniature to miniature. As a general rule, terrain that blocks  
[[line of sight]] to half or more of a mini placed directly behind it  
can provide cover to that mini, while terrain that blocks less  
than half of a mini does not. These terrain determinations  
should be made before the game; while playing the game, cover  
is resolved according to the rules on [[page 8]].  
Terrain either provides [[no cover]], [[light cover]], or [[heavy cover]],  
depending on its characteristics. Terrain that completely blocks  
[[line of sight]] always provides heavy cover.
