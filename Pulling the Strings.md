[[Card Actions]], [[Free Actions]]

A unit with the pulling the strings keyword exerts  
tremendous influence over the other units around them.  
Pulling the strings is a card ability and can be used by  
spending an action during that unit’s activation. When a unit  
uses the pulling the strings ability, choose another friendly  
trooper unit at range 1–2. The chosen unit may perform a free  
attack action or a free move action.  

• The free attack action or free move action granted by the  
pulling the strings ability is a free action and therefore  
triggers abilities that occur after actions, attack actions, or  
move actions are performed.  

• The attack or move granted by the pulling the strings  
ability triggers abilities that occur after an attack or a move  
is performed.  

• The attack granted by the pulling the strings ability does  
not count against that unit's one attack action during its  
activation that round.
