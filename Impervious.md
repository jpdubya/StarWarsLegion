[[Attack]], [[Dice]], [[Pierce X]]

While a unit with the impervious keyword is defending, it rolls a  
number of additional defense dice equal to the **[[pierce x]]** value of  
the attack pool.  

• The number of additional defense dice rolled is regardless of  
the number of ![[HitIcon.png]] and ![[CritIcon.png]] results rolled during the attack.  

_For example, during an attack, after the “Modify Attack Dice”  
step, there are 2 ![[HitIcon.png]] results and 1 ![[CritIcon.png]] result, and the attack pool has  
pierce 3. If the defender has the impervious keyword, it would  
roll 6 of its defense dice during the “Roll Defense Dice” step._

• After rolling additional defense dice, ![[BlockIcon.png]] results are still  
canceled as normal during the “Modify Defense Dice” step by  
the pierce x keyword.  

_For example, in the above attack, after rolling defense dice, there  
are 4 ![[BlockIcon.png]] results. Pierce 3 cancels 3 of those ![[BlockIcon.png]] results, leaving 1  
![[BlockIcon.png]] result. There were 2 ![[HitIcon.png]] results and 1 ![[CritIcon.png]] result; thus during the  
“[[Compare Results]]” step the defender would suffer 2 wounds._

• A defender with impervious rolls additional dice equal to  
the pierce x value in the attack pool, regardless of whether  
pierce is applied to the defender’s dice or to dice rolled by  
another unit using the guardian keyword during the attack.  

• If a unit has both the impervious keyword and the  
immune: pierce keyword, the impervious keyword has no  
effect because pierce x is not being used during that attack.
