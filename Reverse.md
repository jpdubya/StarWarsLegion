Reversing is a type of movement that allows a notched-base  
mini to move backward.  

• When performing a reverse, a player begins by placing the  
start of the movement tool into the rear notch of the mini’s  
base. When finishing a full reverse, a player places the front  
notch on the mini’s base onto the end of the movement  
tool. A player can perform a partial reverse with a mini if  
they desire.  

• Only ground vehicle, creature trooper, and emplacement  
trooper units can perform a reverse.  

• While performing a reverse, a mini moves along the path  
created by the movement tool and its base must not overlap  
terrain or units that it cannot move through.  

» A mini may stop moving anywhere along the path of the  
movement tool to perform a partial move.

• A player can adjust the joint of the movement tool while  
performing a reverse.  

• A unit reduces its speed by 1, to a minimum of 1, while  
performing a reverse.  
» Reversing through difficult terrain can cause a unit’s  
speed to be reduced by 2, but only to a minimum of 1.  
» Performing a reverse while having 1 or more immobilize  
tokens can cause a unit’s speed to be zero. 

• A reverse is a move. It is ==not a standard move== or a  
speed-x move.
