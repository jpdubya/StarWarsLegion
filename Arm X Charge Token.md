[[Detonate X: Charge Type]] (Weapon Keyword), [[Weapons]]

A unit that is equipped with a card that has the **arm x: charge type** keyword can perform the arm x action. To perform this action, the unit places x charge tokens of the specified type within range 1 and in line of sight of its unit leader.  

• Charge tokens cannot overlap any objective, condition, or  
other charge tokens, and must be placed on a flat surface,  
completely flush with that surface.  

• Charge tokens can be placed under both friendly and enemy  
minis. When doing so, mark the mini’s position before  
moving it aside; then, after placing the charge token, return  
the mini to its previous location.  

• When placing charge tokens, the blue player should place  
their charge tokens with the blue side faceup, and the  
red player should place their charge tokens with the red  
side faceup.
