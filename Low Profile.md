[[Attack]], [[Cover]]

While defending against an attack, if a unit with the low  
profile keyword has cover, caancel one additional hit result.  

• When determining cover, if the attack pool has **[[blast]]**, you  
do not cancel one additional hit result as the effects of cover  
are ignored.  

• When determining cover, if the value of **[[Sharpshooter x]]**  
is equal to or greater than the level of cover, low profile  
has no effect.
