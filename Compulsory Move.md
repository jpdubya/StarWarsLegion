[[Displacement]], [[Movement]], [[Speeder X]]

Some game effects require a unit to perform a compulsory move  
at the start or end of the Perform Actions step of its activation.  


• A compulsory move is a free standard move action.  

» A compulsory move triggers abilities that occur after  
move actions are performed. However, as a free action,  
it does not count against the unit’s two actions per  
activation.  


• While performing a compulsory move, if a unit's maximum  
speed is reduced, that unit is still considered to be  
performing a move at its maximum speed.  


• To perform a compulsory move, the unit performs a full  
move at its maximum speed. If it cannot do so, or if a full  
move would cause any part of the unit leader’s base to be  
outside the battlefield, it can perform a partial move instead,  
ending its movement as far along the movement template  
as possible. If the unit performs a partial movement in  
this way, the unit suffers a number of wounds equal to its maximum speed.  

» As the unit leader moves along a movement tool, if  
at any point the unit leader's base is outside of the  
battlefield, the unit is defeated.  


• The final position of a compulsory move can displace  
trooper units.  


• When a unit performs a compulsory move, the bases of the  
minis in the unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as  
each mini is stable and is not precariously placed. If there is  
not room to place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the  
unit is moving onto, or if any mini’s base cannot be placed  
legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot complete the  
compulsory move.  


• During a compulsory move, if the unit leader would end its  
movement on a piece of terrain it would normally ignore  
due to the **[[speeder x]]** keyword or the repulsor vehicle unit  
type, it may shift backwards along the movement tool by  
a distance no greater than half the length of its base, so  
that its base is able to be placed legally on the battlefield or  
terrain piece. It may not do so if the terrain is not ignored  
by the **speeder x** keyword or the repulsor vehicle unit  
type and would cause the unit to be unable to complete the  
compulsory move.

» A unit leader’s base may only be moved backwards along  
the movement tool, it cannot be moved forward past the  
end of the movement tool.  

» A unit leader’s base cannot be moved back more than  
half the diameter of the base.  

» A unit leader must still move as far along the movement  
tool as possible, it may move back only to allow its  
base to be placed legally and in a stable position on the  
battlefield or piece of terrain.  

» If the unit leader still cannot be legally placed on the  
battlefield, it moves as far along the movement tool as  
possible and takes damage equal to its speed for failing  
to complete its compulsory move.  


• If a unit has both the **ai: move** keyword and an effect that  
requires it to perform a compulsory move, the compulsory  
move does ==not== satisfy the requirements of **[[AI Move]]**.
