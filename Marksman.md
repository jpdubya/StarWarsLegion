[[Aim]], [[Attack]]

While performing an attack, a unit with the marksman  
keyword can spend aim tokens to improve attack die results  
instead of rerolling dice. After the Convert Attack Surges step  
and before the Apply Dodge and Cover step, the unit may spend  
any number of aim tokens. For each aim token spent in this  
way, change a blank result to a hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result or a hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) result 
to a critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) result.  

• A unit may spend two aim tokens to change a blank result to  
a (![[CritIcon.png]]) result.

• Aim tokens spent in this way have no other effect.
