[[Immune Pierce]] (unit keyword), [[Melee]], [[Pierce X]] (Weapon Keyword)

Those who have masted the Makashi style have turned  
lightsaber dueling into a true art form. While a unit with the  
makashi mastery keyword performs a melee attack, it can  
reduce the **[[pierce x]]** value of the weapon with which it is  
performing the attack by 1. If it does, the defender cannot use  
the **[[immune pierce]]** and **[[impervious]]** keywords.
