[[Attack]], [[Cancel]], [[Dice]], [[Guardian X]] (Unit  
Keyword), [[Weapons]]

During the “Modify Defense Dice” step of an attack, a unit  
whose attack pool includes a weapon that has the pierce x  
keyword can cancel up to x block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results.  

• The pierce x keyword can be used to cancel block (![[BlockIcon.png]])  
results on defense dice rolled by a unit using the **[[guardian x]]** 
keyword. When doing so, treat canceled block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results  
as blank results. After using pierce x in this way, any  
unused pierce x value can still be used to cancel block (![[BlockIcon.png]])  
results rolled by the defender.  

_For example, a unit with pierce 3 attacks an enemy unit,  
and another enemy unit uses guardian 2 to cancel 2 hit (![[HitIcon.png]])  
results. After converting defense surge (![[CritIcon.png]]) results, the unit  
using guardian has rolled 2 block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results. The attacking  
unit uses pierce to cancel the 2 block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results and the unit  
using guardian suffers 2 wounds._

_Now the defender rolls defense dice, and the attacking unit  
can cancel 1 more block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) result rolled by the defender since  
only 2 of its original pierce 3 was used so far_
