[[Armor]] (Unit Keyword), [[Armor X]] (Unit  
Keyword), [[Attack]], [[Dice]], [[Weapons]]

During the “[[Modify Attack Dice]]” step of an attack, if the  
defender has the **[[armor]]** keyword, a unit whose attack pool  
includes a weapon that has the impact x keyword can modify  
the results of the attack roll by changing hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results to  
critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results. The unit can change a number of hit (![[HitIcon.png]])  
results to critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results up to the value of x.  

• If the attacker is performing an attack against multiple  
targets, the attacker can modify only dice in the attack pool
that the weapon with the impact x keyword contributed to.  

• If a unit performs an attack using multiple weapons that  
have the impact x keyword and those weapons contribute  
dice to the same attack pool, the x values of each impact x  
keyword are cumulative.  

_For example, a unit that performs an attack using both a  
weapon that has impact 1 and a weapon that has impact  
2 contribute dice to the attack pool, that attack is treated as  
using a weapon that has impact 3 which allows that unit to  
change up to three hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results to critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results._ 

• The attacker resolves abilities during the “Modify Attack  
Dice” step of an attack before the defender resolves abilities  
during that step. As such, the impact x keyword can be  
used to change hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results to critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results before  
the armor keyword can be used to cancel hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results.
