[[Actions]], [[Aim]], [[Dodge]], [[Suppression]]

Calculating the odds of success in the midst of combat can be  
vital, but it can also be extremely annoying. As a card action, a  
unit with the **calculate odds** keyword can choose a friendly  
trooper unit at range 1 and in line to sight to gain 1 aim token, 1  
dodge token, and 1 suppression token.  

• A unit using the **calculate odds** ability can choose itself.  

• This effect is different than performing an aim action, and  
therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim  
actions are performed.  

• This effect is different than performing a dodge action, and  
therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after dodge  
actions are performed.
