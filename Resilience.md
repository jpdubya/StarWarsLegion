[[Damaged]], [[Disabled]], [[Weapon Disrupted]]

Resilience is an attribute presented on each  
vehicle’s unit card.  
• A vehicle unit’s resilience is indicated by  
the value next to the resilience icon.  
• When a vehicle suffers wounds, if this causes it to have  
wound tokens equal to or exceeding its resilience value,  
that player rolls a red defense die and suffers one of the  
following results:  
» **Damaged**: If the result is a block (![[BlockIcon.png]]), the unit is  
damaged and gains a damaged token. When a player  
activates a damaged unit, they roll a white defense die.  
If the result is a blank, that vehicle performs one fewer  
action during its activation.
**Disabled**: If the result is a blank, the unit is disabled  
and gains a disabled token. A unit that is disabled  
cannot reverse and must spend two actions to perform a  
standard move
» **Weapon Disrupted**: If the result is a defense surge  
(![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]), one of the unit’s weapons is disrupted. The player’s  
opponent chooses one of that unit’s weapons and a  
weapon disrupted token is placed on the corresponding  
card. When adding that weapon to an attack pool, only  
half its dice can be added (of any color, rounding up).  
• Damaged tokens, disabled tokens, and weapon disrupted  
tokens are different types of vehicle damage tokens.  
• If a vehicle has already received a vehicle damage token  
due to suffering wounds equal to or exceeding its resilience  
value, it cannot gain another vehicle damage token, of the
same or a different type, due to suffering additional wounds,  
but can gain one through other game effects.  
» If a vehicle already has wounds equal to or exceeding its  
resilience value and received a vehicle damage token, the  
player does not need to roll a red defense die when that  
vehicle suffers wounds.  
• If a vehicle damage token that was gained due to suffering  
wounds is removed from a vehicle, when that vehicle suffers  
wounds equal to or exceeding its resilience value it does not  
gain another vehicle damage token.  
• Some vehicle units do not have a resilience value. These  
units have a “–” presented on their unit card where a  
resilience value would normally be.  
» A vehicle unit without a resilience value cannot be  
damaged, disabled, or have one of its weapons disrupted.
