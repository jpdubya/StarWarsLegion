[[Command Cards]], [[Command Phase]], [[Dice]]

Command cards grant players priority based on the number of  
pips presented in the upper-left corner of the card. Each card  
has zero to four pips.  

• When players reveal their command cards during the  
Command Phase, the player whose card has the fewest  
number of pips has priority.  
» If both players reveal a card that has the same number  
of pips, the player who has the round counter rolls a  
red defense die. If the result of the roll is a block (![[BlockIcon.png]]),  
that player has priority. Otherwise, their opponent  
has priority.  

• The player with priority resolves their command card first  
during the Command Phase and takes the first turn during  
the Activation Phase.
