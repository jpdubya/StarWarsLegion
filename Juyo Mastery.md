[[Actions]], [[Activating Units]], [[Wounds]]

When practicing the Juyo lightsaber form, a form strongly  
associated with the dark side of the force, the user taps into  
their inner rage, hatred, and pain to enhance and fuel their  
combat prowess. While a unit with the juyo mastery keyword  
has one or more wound tokens, it can perform one additional  
action during its activation.  

• While the effects of juyo mastery are active during a  
unit’s activation, that unit is limited to two move actions,  
including free move actions.  

• The effects of juyo mastery apply even during an activation  
in which a unit is suppressed. A unit that is suppressed and  
under the effects of juyo mastery would have two actions  
available during its activation.  

• A unit under the effects of juyo mastery that panics still  
only performs one move action during its activation, as per  
the rules of panicking.

• If a unit with juyo mastery is not wounded at the start of  
its activation, but becomes wounded during its activation,  
it gains the benefit of juyo mastery and can perform an  
additional action during that activation.  

• If a unit with juyo mastery is already wounded during
its activation, but has all wound tokens removed during  
that activation, such that it is not longer wounded, it loses  
the benefit of juyo mastery and any actions performed  
during it’s activation up to that point are counted against the  
normal number of actions it would be allowed to perform.
