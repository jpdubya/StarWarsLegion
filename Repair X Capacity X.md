[[Free Card Actions]], [[Ion Tokens]], [[Vehicle Damage Tokens]], [[Wounds]]

Repair x: capacity y is a card ability and can be performed  
as an action or free action (depending on the card) during a  
unit’s activation. When a unit uses the repair x: capacity y  
ability, place one wound token on the card that has the repair  
x: capacity y keyword, and choose a friendly droid trooper or  
vehicle unit at range 1 and in line of sight. Remove a total of up  
to x wound, ion, and/or vehicle damage tokens from the chosen  
unit or restore up to x miniatures to that unit. This ability  
cannot be used if the card that has the repair x: capacity  
y keyword has a number of wound tokens on it equal to or  
exceeding y.  

• Wound tokens on cards are not considered to be on units  
and do not count toward a unit’s wound threshold, nor can  
they be removed by abilities that remove wound tokens  
from units.  

• Vehicle damage tokens include the damaged token, the 

• Vehicle damage tokens include the damaged token, the  
disabled token, and the weapon disrupted token.

• Repair x: capacity y can be used on units that have the  
droid trooper, ground vehicle, or repulsor vehicle unit type. 

• If all of a unit’s minis have been defeated, it is no longer  
in play, and cannot be chosen when using the repair x:  
capacity y ability.  

• If a unit has multiple repair x: capacity y abilities, treat  
each keyword as a separate ability.  

_For example, if a unit of Stormtroopers equips both Del  
Meeko (gaining repair 2: capacity 1) and an R4 Astromech  
(gaining repair 1: capacity 2), the unit can choose which  
ability to use._

» Additionally, each action is considered to be unique, and  
a unit that has access to both can use each ability once  
during its activation. This applies even if the unit has  
access to two identical abilities from different sources,  
such as a unit of Rebel Troopers that has acquired two  
copies of the Arc Welder supply card.
