[[Base]], [[Cohesion]], [[Movement]], [[Reverse]], [[Vehicles]]

Some units, notably vehicles, have front and rear notches on  
their bases.  
• When a mini with a notched base performs a move, a player  
places the movement tool into either the front or rear notch  
on the base.  
» When performing a standard move, they begin by  
placing the start of the movement tool into the front  
notch of the mini’s base. When finishing a full move,  
they place the rear notch of the mini’s base onto the end  
of the movement tool.  
» When performing a reverse, they begin by placing the  
start of the movement tool into the rear notch of the  
mini’s base. When finishing a full reverse, they place  
the front notch of the mini’s base onto the end of the  
movement tool.
• When a mini with a notched base is placed in cohesion, its  
base must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit  
leader’s base.  
• When a mini with a notched base climbs or clambers, its  
base must be oriented in the exact same direction as it was  
before it climbed or clambered.  
• The space created by the notch in a mini's base should  
be treated as a part of that mini's base by other minis.  
Therefore, no mini’s base may be placed inside the notches  
of another mini’s base.
