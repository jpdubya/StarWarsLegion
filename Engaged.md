[[Base Contact]], [[Melee]], [[Troopers]], [[Withdraw]]

While a trooper unit is in a melee with another trooper unit,  
those units are engaged. A unit that is engaged cannot perform  
moves, cannot be displaced, cannot perform ranged attacks, and  
cannot be targeted by ranged attacks, except from area weapons.  

• Trooper units can only be engaged with other trooper units.  
Trooper units cannot be engaged with vehicles, and vehicles  
cannot be engaged with other vehicles, even if both units are  
in a melee.  

• If a trooper unit is engaged, it can leave that melee by  
withdrawing during its activation. For additional rules, see  
[[Withdraw]]
