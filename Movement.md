• The primary way that units move is by performing a move  
action. When a unit performs a move action, it performs  
a standard move, reverse, strafe, pivot, climb, clamber,  
embark, or disembark.

• To perform a standard move, a player performs the  
following steps:  

# Steps

1. **Take Movement Tool**: The player chooses a movement tool.  
» Each unit has a maximum speed of one, two, or three,  
which is represented by a number of red bars on the  
unit’s card. When a unit performs a standard move, it  
uses a movement tool with a value equal to or less than  
its maximum speed.  

2. **Place Movement Tool**: The player places the movement tool  
against the moving unit’s base, according to the type of base:  
» Unnotched Base:Unnotched Base: The player places one end of the  
movement tool flush against any portion of the unit  
leader mini’s base.
» **Notched Base**: The player places one end of the  
movement tool into the front notch of the vehicle’s base.  

3. **Adjust Movement Tool**: The player can adjust the  
movement tool at its joint, bending it as they desire.  
The movement tool creates a path along which the mini  
will move.  

4. **Execute Full or Partial Move**: The player executes either a  
full or partial move.  

» **Full**: Holding the movement tool in place, the player lifts  
up the unit leader mini and moves it along the path of  
the movement tool, keeping the mini’s base centered in  
relation to the width of the tool. Then, if the mini has an  
unnotched base, the player places the mini’s base flush  
against the other end of the movement tool; if the mini  
has a notched base, the player places the mini so the  
other end of the movement tool is inserted into the rear  
notch of the mini’s base.
» **Partial**: Holding the movement tool in place, the player  
lifts up the unit leader mini and moves it along the path  
of the movement tool, keeping the mini’s base centered  
in relation to the width of the tool. Then, the player  
places the mini anywhere along the path created by the  
movement tool, moving the movement tool out of the  
way and placing the mini on the battlefield.  
When placing a mini with a notched base during a  
partial move, the unit must be placed such that the  
central axis of the mini’s front and back notches is  
parallel to the section of the movement tool the mini  
reached at the furthest part of its move.  

5. **Establish Cohesion**: The player places all minis of the  
moving unit that are not the unit leader in cohesion with the  
unit leader (see "Cohesion" on page 24).  
» When a notched base mini is placed in cohesion, its base  
must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit  
leader’s base.

• During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to perform  
multiple move actions. Unlike other actions, a unit is ==not==  
limited to only one move action per activation.

• While moving a mini along a path created by a movement  
tool, if the base of the mini is impeded by an object, that  
mini must stop its movement prematurely unless the  
mini can legally move through, over, or on top of the  
obstructing object.  

• While performing a standard move, a reverse, or a strafe, if  
it is obvious that the mini will be unimpeded while moving  
along the path created by the movement tool, the mini can  
be placed directly at its final destination.  

• While moving a unit, if a movement tool cannot lie flat on  
the battlefield, the player can hold the tool above any objects  
that prevent the tool from lying flat, or mark the objects’  
positions and move them out of the way while performing  
the move.  

• A mini can move into base contact with an enemy mini only  
if the unit performing the move has a melee weapon and is  
entering into a melee with that enemy unit.

• If a unit performs a move that causes any part of its unit  
leader's base to be outside of the battlefield, including while  
moving along a movement tool, that unit is defeated.  

• Unless a unit is able to displace other minis, the final  
position of a unit after a move cannot overlap the bases of  
other minis.  

• The final position of a unit after a move cannot overlap  
objective or condition tokens.  

• The bases of minis can partially overhang ledges, as long as  
the mini is stable and is not precariously placed.

• A unit must be placed as flat as possible on the battlefield  
after performing any type of move. Not all terrain that a  
unit could end their move on top of is perfectly flat and  
players should agree before playing as to what terrain units  
cannot end their movement on; however, as a general rule,  
if overlapping a piece of terrain causes a mini to be unstable  
or fall over, or causes the mini’s base to be at an angle  
greater than 45 degrees, that mini cannot end a move in  
that position.  

• If a game effect allows or forces a unit to perform a  
“speed-x” move, that unit performs a full or partial standard  
move with a speed equal to or lower than “x.” Climbing,  
clambering, embarking, disembarking, reversing, strafing,  
and pivoting are not standard moves and thus cannot be  
performed in place of a speed-x move.
