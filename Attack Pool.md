An attack pool is a number of dice generated from weapons that  
are being used against a single target during an attack.  

• Each weapon that is used during an attack contributes one  
or more dice to an attack pool.  

• During an attack, the attacker can create multiple attack  
pools to attack multiple defenders. However, only one attack  
pool can be assigned to each defender.

![[Attacking Multiple Units]]

• An attack pool can consist of dice from different weapons,  
but all weapons with an identical name must contribute  
their dice to the same attack pool.  

• A weapon can only contribute its dice to an attack pool if  
the following restrictions are met:  
[[#Contribute]]

• Each weapon that contributes dice to an attack pool also  
applies its keywords to that attack pool.
[[#Keywords]]

_For example, if a weapon that has the blast keyword  
contributed dice to an attack pool, the results from all the  
dice in that attack pool ignore the defender’s cover.  _



# Contribute
» The range of the attack is equal to or greater than the  
weapons’ minimum range and equal to or less than the  
weapon’s maximum range.  
» The miniature using the weapon has line of sight to at  
least one mini in the defending unit.  
» If the weapon can exhaust, it must be readied.
» To add a weapon with the fixed: x keyword to the attack  
pool, the defender must be inside the specified firing arc  
of the attacking mini.  

# Keywords
» If a weapon has a keyword that allows a player to modify  
one or more dice in the attack pool, the player can use  
that effect to modify any dice in the attack pool, not just  
the dice that this weapon contributed.  
» If a weapon has a keyword that changes how the results  
of the attack roll affects the defender, the entire attack  
roll affects the defender in that way, not just dice that the  
weapon that has that keyword contributed.
