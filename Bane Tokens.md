Cad Bane has a set of three unique Bane tokens  
that he can place on the battlefield. Bane tokens  
are double-sided, with a uniform back and three  
different images on the front, each linked to a  
unique effect.  
• Bane tokens must be placed facedown on the battlefield.  
Bane tokens cannot overlap condition or objective tokens.  
• Bane Tokens are enemy effects.  
• After an mini moves, deploys, or is placed at range 1 of an  
enemy Bane token, if that mini has line of sight to the token,  
the token is revealed. Miniatures can move through but  
cannot overlap Bane tokens.  
• When a Bane token is revealed, it has the following effect,  
according to the image on its front:

Here I Am  
» Here I Am: If Cad Bane is not on the  
battlefield and is not defeated, his Here I Am  
token is replaced by his miniature. Then,  
Cad Bane issues himself an order.  
If Cad Bane is on the battlefield, his Here I  
am Token is replaced by his miniature. Any tokens  
assigned to Cad Bane remain assigned to him.  
If Cad Bane is defeated, the token  
is removed.  
» Smoke and Mirrors: The token is removed.  
» Kablamo!: The token detonates using the  
weapon profile on Cad Bane’s Command  
Card “I Make the Rules Now.” Then, the  
token is removed.  
• Each player may have only one copy of each  
different Bane token on the battlefield at the  
same time.  
• At the start of any round, starting with the blue player, a  
player may reveal a friendly Here I Am token and resolve it.
