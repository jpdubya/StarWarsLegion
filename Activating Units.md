During the Activation Phase, players take turns activating their units. 

• When a unit activates, that unit can perform up to  
two actions.  

• The steps of unit activation are as follows:  

1. **Start of Unit Activation**: If there is an effect that triggers  
“when” a unit activates or “at the start” of its activation, that  
effect triggers during this step.  
	» If more than one effect takes place at the start of a unit’s  
	activation, the player that controls that unit decides the  
	order of these effects.  
	» At the start of a vehicle unit’s activation, if that unit is  
	damaged, it must roll a white defense die. If this roll  
	produces a blank result, it can perform only one action,  
	instead of two.  
	
2. **Rally**: If the unit has one or more suppression tokens, it rolls  
one white defense die for each suppression token it has. For  
each block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) or defense surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]) result the roll produces, the unit removes one of its suppression tokens. 

3. **Perform Actions**: A unit that is not suppressed can perform  
up to two actions and any number of free actions. A unit  
that is suppressed or that has lost an action due to being  
damaged can perform only one action and any number of  
free actions.  
	» A droid trooper or vehicle unit also loses one action for  
	each ion token that unit has when it activates.  
	» After a player activates a unit, that player places its order  
	token facedown (rank side down) on the battlefield near  
	the unit leader.  

4. **End of Unit Activation**: If there is an effect that triggers “at  
the end” of a unit's activation, that effect triggers during this  
step.  
	» If more than one effect takes place at the end of a unit’s  
	activation, the player that controls that unit decides the  
	order of these effects.
