![[Advanced Cohesion]]

Each non-leader miniature in a unit must be in cohesion with  
its unit leader.  

• After a unit leader moves, is deployed to the battlefield, or  
is displaced on the battlefield, each other mini in that unit  
must be placed in cohesion with that unit leader. 


• A mini is in cohesion with its unit leader if the distance  
between a mini and its unit leader is equal to or less than the  
length of the speed-1 movement tool.  

» If the base of a unit leader is touching one end of the  
speed-1 movement tool, and the base of a different mini  
in that unit is touching the other end of the speed-1  
movement tool, those minis are at the maximum  
distance of cohesion.  


• When a notched base mini is placed in cohesion, its base  
must be oriented in the exact same direction as the unit  
leader’s base.  

• When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed in  
base contact with enemy minis, unless the unit is in a [[Melee]].  


• When moving a unit leader, a player can push aside any  
minis from that unit to make it easier to place the movement  
tool on the battlefield.  


• If moving multiple units at the same time because of  
displacement, a player can move the unit leaders from those  
units first, and then place the remaining minis in cohesion  
with their respective leaders.  


• When placing minis in cohesion, the bases of the minis in  
the unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as the mini is  
stable and is not precariously placed.  


• When placing a mini in cohesion with its unit leader, that  
mini must be placed such that the distance between the mini  
and its unit leader could be made as a legal speed-1 move  
from the final position of the unit leader.  

» This means that when placing a mini in cohesion with  
its unit leader it cannot be placed on the other side of  
impassable terrain from its unit leader.  

» However, minis being placed in cohesion are considered  
to be able to move through any enemy trooper minis
with which they are engaged.  

» Notched-based minis must obey this rule; however, the  
speed-1 move between the mini’s position and the unit  
leader’s position is determined as if both the mini and  
the unit leader can pivot up to 1800 before and after the  
move is measured.  

_For example, a mini is placed such that the distance  
between it and its unit leader is equal to or less than the  
length of the speed-1 movement tool; however, there is  
a piece of blocking terrain between the mini and its unit  
leader. If the mini is placed in such a way that there is a  
legal speed-1 move around the piece of blocking terrain  
between the position of the mini and the position of the  
unit leader, then cohesion is maintained, but if there is not  
a legal speed-1 move between the position of the mini and  
the position of the leader, then the mini is not in cohesion._  


• When separated by vertical distances, the position of a mini  
from the position of its unit leader must also be a legal climb  
move. If a unit leader is on top of elevated terrain, any minis  
in that unit that are below their unit leader must be in base  
contact with that terrain such that moving between the  
position of the leader and the position of any mini in the  
unit is a legal climb move.  

» In order for the distance between a mini’s position and  
its unit leader’s position to be a legal climb move, it must  
be height 1 or lower.  

» After climbing or clambering, the unit leader will by  
default be on the edge of the terrain closest to the point  
with which it was in base contact before climbing or  
clambering. Minis not placed on the same edge of the  
terrain as the leader must be placed in base contact with  
the terrain edge and as close as possible to this point.  


• When placing a trooper mini in cohesion, it cannot be  
placed higher than the level to which its unit leader climbed  
or clambered (or lower than the level to which its unit leader  
climbed or clambered if the unit leader moved downwards).  


• When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed onto  
a different level of terrain than its unit leader, unless that  
mini’s unit leader has just climbed or clambered. Minis can  
always be placed onto the same level as their unit leader  
when being placed in cohesion.  

» If a unit performs a move that ignores terrain of a  
certain height, such as via the hover: air x, jump x, or  
speeder x keywords, minis can be placed onto different  
levels of terrain than their unit leader, as long as the  
vertical distance between the levels is equal to or less  
than the height of terrain that is ignored.
