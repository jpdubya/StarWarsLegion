[[Abilities]], [[Setup]], [[Scout X]]

The scouting party x keyword allows especially skilled scouts  
to lead a small band of troopers into a forward position. After  
a unit with the scouting party x keyword uses the scout  
keyword, it may choose up to x friendly trooper units at range  
1â€“2 that have not performed a move using the scout keyword.  
Each chosen unit may perform a move with a speed equal to  
x, where x is the scout x value of the unit with the scouting  
party keyword.
