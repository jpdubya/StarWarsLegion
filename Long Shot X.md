[[Aim]], [[Attack]], [[Range]]

While a unit is performing a ranged attack, during the Form  
Attack Pool step, it may spend up to x aim tokens to increase
the maximum range of a weapon with the long shot x  
keyword by 1 for each aim token spent in this way.  

• Aim tokens spent in this way have no other effect.  

• The long shot x keyword applies only to the weapon with  
the keyword and can be used only to extend the range of  
that weapon.
