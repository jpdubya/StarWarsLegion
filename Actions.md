During the [[Activation Phase]], each unit can perform actions.  
• When a unit is activated, it can perform two actions from  
the following list:  
» [[Move]]

» [[Attack]]  

» [[Aim]]  

» [[Dodge]]  

» [[Standby]]  

» [[Recover]]  

» [[Card Action]]

• A unit cannot perform the same action more than once  
during its activation, except the move action, which can be  
performed multiple times.  

• If an ability is preceded by a card action (![[Pasted image 20220118130742.png]]) icon, that ability is a card action.  
	» Each card action is a unique action; a unit can perform  
	different card actions during its activation. However, a  
	unit cannot perform the same card action more than  
	once during its activation.

• If an ability is preceded by a free card action (![[Pasted image 20220118130805.png]]) icon, that  
ability is a free card action. Free card actions do not count  
against the two actions that a unit can perform during  
its activation.  
	» Each free card action is a unique action; a unit can  
	perform different free card actions during its activation.  
	However, a unit cannot perform the same free card  
	action more than once during its activation.  

• Suppression and damage can reduce the number of actions a  
unit can perform during its activation.  

• Through the use of free actions, a unit can perform more  
than two actions.  
 
• If an effect provides a unit with a free action of a certain  
type, such as a free attack action, performing that free action  
does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation,  
but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects  
and therefore does not allow a unit to perform the same  
non-move action more than once during its activation. 

_**For example**, Darth Vader performs a move action, triggering  
his relentless ability and allowing him to perform a free  
attack action. After this free attack action, Darth Vader still  
has one of his two actions remaining, but he cannot use this  
remaining action to perform another attack action._

• If an effect provides a unit with a free action without  
specifying a type of action, that unit may perform any action  
that it could normally perform. Performing that free action  
does not count against that unit’s two actions per activation,  
but is considered an action for the purposes of game effects  
and therefore does not allow a unit to perform the same  
non-move action more than once during its activation.  

• During a unit’s activation, it is possible for it to perform  
multiple attacks through the use of command cards or other  
abilities. If an effect provides a unit with an attack during  
its activation, and that attack is not an action or free action,  
performing that attack does not count toward a unit’s limit  
of a single attack action per activation. It is not an action  
and therefore does not count against that unit’s two actions  
per activation and does not trigger abilities that occur after  
actions are performed.  

_**For example**, Han Solo performs an attack action. After  
completing the attack, his gunslinger keyword allows him to  
perform an additional ranged attack. This additional attack  
is not an attack action, and therefore can be performed, even  
though Han Solo has already performed an attack action._  

• Card effects can allow units to gain aim, dodge, and standby  
tokens. If an effect specifically instructs a unit to gain an  
aim, dodge, or standby token, that effect is different than  
performing an aim, dodge, or standby action and therefore  
does not trigger abilities or effects that occur after aim,  
dodge, or standby actions are performed.
