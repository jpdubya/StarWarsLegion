When a ground vehicle or creature trooper moves through  
trooper miniatures, it displaces them.  

• When a ground vehicle or creature trooper mini moves  
along the path created by a movement tool, if its base would  
overlap any trooper minis, those minis are displaced.  

• When a repulsor vehicle mini’s final position would overlap  
one or more trooper minis during a **compulsory** move,  
those minis are displaced.  

• Trooper units that are engaged cannot be displaced, and thus  
cannot be moved through by ground vehicles or creature  
troopers. Repulsor vehicles and other trooper units can  
move through engaged troopers.  
» Creature and emplacement troopers cannot be displaced,  
and thus cannot be moved through by ground vehicles  
and other creature troopers.  
» While withdrawing, creature trooper minis can displace  
non-creature, non-emplacement trooper minis with  
which they are engaged.  

• To displace a unit, players perform the following steps:

1. **Set Aside Minis**: Any displaced minis are placed to the side  
of the battlefield without disrupting other minis or objects  
on the battlefield. If a unit leader is displaced, a player  
should mark its original position using a spare token.  

2. **Move**: The mini that displaced the trooper minis continues  
its move as normal, unimpeded by the minis it displaced.  

3. **Place Units**: The player who did not move that unit takes all  
of the displaced minis (both friendly and enemy) and places  
them back on the battlefield.
» Each mini must be placed in cohesion with its  
unit leader.  
» If a unit leader was displaced, it must be placed at  
speed-1 of its original position. After the leader is  
placed, any minis of that unit that are not in cohesion are  
placed in cohesion; this could cause a mini that was not  
displaced to be moved.  
» When placing a displaced mini, it cannot be placed in  
base contact with an enemy mini.  
» When placing a displaced mini, it must remain on its  
original elevation, if possible.  

4. **Gain Suppression**: Each unit that had one or more minis  
displaced gains one suppression token.  
» A unit cannot gain more than one suppression token  
due to being displaced in a single activation, even if it is  
displaced multiple times that activation.
