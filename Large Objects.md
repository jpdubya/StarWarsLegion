Large objects like buildings, moisture collectors, hills, and  
high walls have a substantial impact on the environment, often  
blocking line of sight and movement completely.  

Some terrain pieces do not fit neatly into a single category, but  
are instead composed of several different terrain types. This is  
most commonly found in buildings.  

Buildings come in all shapes and sizes, from the simple huts of  
Tatooine to the fortified bunkers constructed by the Galactic  
Empire. For the sake of simplicity, most buildings are generally  
best treated as large pieces of impassable terrain, but sometimes  
players may wish to incorporate more nuance.  

In particular, buildings will sometimes have parts that are  
impassable while the rest is open or difficult terrain—a mini  
may be able to move through a doorway or a large window as  
open terrain, but the building’s walls are impassable. When  
using a piece of terrain with mixed types, players should clearly  
define the terrain so that there is no ambiguity.
