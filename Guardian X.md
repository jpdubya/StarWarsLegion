[[Attack]], [[Dice]], [[Cancel]], [[Pierce X]] (Weapon  
Keyword), [[Weapons]]

While a friendly trooper unit at range 1 and in line of sight is  
defending against a ranged attack, a unit that has the guardian  
x keyword may cancel up to x hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results. For each hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) 
result canceled, the unit with the guardian x keyword rolls  
a defense die matching its defense. After converting defense  
surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]) results according to its surge chart, the unit with the  
guardian x keyword suffers 1 wound for each blank result.  

• Guardian x cannot be used to cancel critical (![[CritIcon.png]]) results.  

• Hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results are canceled during the “Modify Attack Dice”  
step of an attack.  

• A unit that uses guardian x to cancel hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results is not  
a defender and does not gain suppression tokens.  

• A defender that has all of its hit (![[HitIcon.png]]) results canceled by  
a unit with guardian x is still the defender, and gains a  
suppression token as normal.

• A unit cannot use guardian x if the defender also has the  
guardian x keyword.  

• Guardian x cannot be used by a unit that is being  
transported, nor can it be used to prevent a friendly  
transported unit from suffering wounds while  
being transported.  

• The **[[pierce x]]** keyword can be used to cancel block (![[BlockIcon.png]])  
results on defense dice rolled by a unit using guardian x;  
treat canceled block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results as blank results. After using  
pierce x in this way, any unused pierce x value can still be  
used to cancel block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results rolled by the defender.

_For example, a unit with pierce 3 attacks an enemy unit,  
and another enemy unit uses guardian 2 to cancel 2 hit (![[HitIcon.png]])  
results. After converting defense surge (![[DefenseSurgeIcon.png]]) results, the unit  
using guardian has rolled 2 block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results. The attacking  
unit uses pierce to cancel the 2 block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) results and the unit  
using guardian suffers 2 wounds. Now the defender rolls  
defense dice, and the attacking unit can cancel 1 more block  
(![[BlockIcon.png]]) result rolled by the defender since only 2 of its original  
pierce 3 was used so far.  _

• If multiple friendly units can use the guardian keyword  
during an attack, the player who controls those units  
declares which unit is using guardian and resolves their  
guardian ability before choosing whether to declare that  
another unit is using guardian.
