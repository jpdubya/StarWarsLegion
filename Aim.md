[[Actions]], [[Attack]], [[Dice]]

Units can gain aim tokens that allow them to reroll  
dice during an attack.  

• When a unit performs an aim action, that unit  
gains an aim token. The token is placed on the  
battlefield near the unit leader, and will remain  
with the unit as it moves around the battlefield. 

• Unit abilities and other effects can allow units to gain aim  
tokens. If an effect specifically instructs a unit to gain an aim  
token, that effect is different than performing an aim action  
and therefore does not trigger abilities that occur after aim  
actions are performed.  

• During a unit’s activation, it is possible for a unit to gain  
more than one aim token; however, that unit can perform  
only one aim action.  

• During an attack, a unit can spend one or more aim tokens  
to reroll up to two dice for each aim token spent.  
	» Aim tokens are spent during the “Reroll Dice” substep of  
the “Roll Attack Dice” step of an attack.  

• To spend a unit’s aim token, a player removes it from the  
battlefield and places it in the supply.

• If a unit has multiple aim tokens, that unit can choose to  
spend each subsequent aim token after determining the  
results of rerolls granted from a prior aim token.  

• A unit can reroll the same die multiple times by spending  
multiple aim tokens; however, each die can only be rerolled  
once per aim token.  

• During the End Phase, all unspent aim tokens are returned  
to the supply.
