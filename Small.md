[[Attack]], [[Cover]], [[Line of Sight]], [[Miniature]], [[Range]]

Some minis that are added to units by upgrade cards or  
counterpart cards are very small, and their presence has a  
negligible effect when that unit is targeted by a non-area ranged  
attack. While a unit is defending against a non-area ranged  
attack, each mini with the small keyword is ignored for the  
purposes of determining line of sight, cover, and range.  
• When determining line of sight during a non-area attack,  
ignore each mini with the small keyword in the defending  
unit. Determine line of sight to that unit as normal for all  
other effects.  
» If a mini with the small keyword is the only mini in  
a unit visible to an enemy unit, that unit cannot be  
attacked by that enemy unit.  
» A mini with the small keyword still suffers wounds as  
normal if the attacking unit would otherwise have line of  
sight to it during an attack.
• When determining cover during an attack, ignore each mini  
with the small keyword in the defending unit.  
» For the purposes of determining cover, each mini with  
the small keyword is treated as though it were not a  
part of the defending unit.  
• When determining range to a defending unit during an  
attack, ignore each mini with the small keyword in the  
defending unit. Measure range to that unit as normal for all  
other effects.  
» If a mini with the small keyword is the only mini in a
unit that an enemy unit’s weapons would have range to,  
that unit cannot be attacked by that enemy unit.  
• The small keyword is used only during ranged attacks.
