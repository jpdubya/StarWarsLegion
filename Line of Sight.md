[[Additional Terrain Rules]]

Line of sight is used to determine if one mini can see another  
mini. A player determines line of sight from the perspective of  
a mini, using a viewpoint where the center of the mini’s base  
meets the top of the mini’s sculpt. If a player can see part of  
an opponent’s mini, which includes that mini’s base, from that  
viewpoint, that player’s mini has line of sight to that opponent’s  
mini.  

• If a mini does not have line of sight to another mini, line of  
sight is blocked.  
» Pieces of terrain and vehicles can block line of sight.  
» Trooper minis do not block line of sight. When  
determining line of sight, if a player cannot see a mini  
because it is concealed by one or more troopers on the  
battlefield, and that player could otherwise see the mini,  
that player’s mini has line of sight to the mini that is  
concealed by one or more troopers.

• During an attack, each mini in the attacker can contribute  
dice to the attack pool if that mini has line of sight to ==any==  
mini in the defender.  

• During an attack, if line of sight to a mini in the defender  
is blocked from all minis in the attacker, that mini in the  
defender cannot suffer wounds.

• A mini cannot block its own line of sight.  

• When determining line of sight from an E-Web Heavy  
Blaster Team mini, players should check from the top of the  
head of the snowtrooper who is firing the E-Web, regardless  
of whether it is directly over the center of the base.  

• When determining line of sight from a DF-90 Mortar  
Trooper Mini, players should check from the top of the head  
of the shoretrooper who is firing the mortar, regardless of  
whether it is directly over the center of the base.  

• When determining line of sight from a TX-225 GAVw  
Occupier, players should check from the center of the roof  
of the crew compartment, regardless of whether it is directly  
over the center of the base.
