[[Commander]], [[Issuing Orders]], [[Order Tokens]]

When a unit with the **authoritative** keyword would be issued  
an order, that unit may issue an order to a friendly unit at range  
1–2 instead.  

• When a unit uses the **authoritative** keyword to  
issue an order to a friendly unit, treat the unit with the  
**authoritative** keyword as if it issued the order.  

• A unit can use the **authoritative** keyword only once  
during each Command Phase.
