If a unit receives too much suppression, it  
can become panicked and attempt to flee
the battlefield.  
• After the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, if the unit has  
a number of suppression tokens that is equal to or greater  
than double its courage value, that unit is panicked.  
» If a unit is at range 1–3 of a friendly commander, it may  
use that commander’s courage value instead of its own  
when checking if it is panicked.  
• When a unit becomes panicked, it gains a panic token. The  
token is placed on the battlefield near the unit leader and  
will remain with the unit as it moves around the battlefield.  
• After the “Rally” step of a unit’s activation, if that unit is  
panicked, it can perform only one action instead of two,  
and that action must be a move action toward the nearest  
battlefield edge.
• When performing its move action, a panicked unit must  
attempt to move off of the battlefield as efficiently as  
possible. That is, the unit must move the entire length of  
the movement tool in the direction of the battlefield edge  
to which that unit is closest. If a unit can move off the  
battlefield more efficiently by moving along an indirect path  
that avoids terrain, the unit should move along that path.  
After the unit leader is moved, however, any remaining  
minis in the unit are placed in cohesion as normal. If the  
unit leader leaves the battlefield, the unit is defeated.  
» A unit with the keywords **[[jump x]]**, **[[reposition]]**, or  
**[[spur]]** must use those keywords if they will enable it to  
move towards the edge of the battlefield as efficiently  
as possible.  
• If a panicked unit no longer has a number of suppression  
tokens equal to or greater than double its courage value, that  
unit is no longer panicked and removes its panic token.
• A panicked unit cannot perform free actions.  
• A panicked unit that is compelled to move vertically to  
move off the battlefield must clamber when doing so.  
• A panicked unit must withdraw if it is engaged, moving  
toward the closest edge of the battlefield.  
• A panicked unit cannot move into a melee with an  
enemy unit.
