[[Deployment]], [[Movement]]

After a unit with the scout x keyword deploys, it may perform  
a standard move, up to speed x.  
• This move may be a full or partial move.  
• A unit can perform this move regardless of its  
maximum speed.  
» A unit that has the scout x keyword and a maximum  
speed of 0 can still perform a speed–x move when  
it deploys.  
• The scout x keyword is cumulative. Thus, if a unit with  
scout 2 gains scout 1, it would have scout 3.  
» The “x” value of the scout x keyword cannot exceed “3.”  
If a unit would ever have scout x exceeding scout 3, it  
has scout 3 instead.  
• A unit with the stationary keyword cannot perform  
standard moves even if it has the scout x keyword.
• A move performed with the scout x keyword is a move, but  
is not a move action.  
• The scout x keyword is only used after a unit is deployed.  
If a unit is placed on the battlefield by a game effect, such  
as the Rapid Reinforcements condition card, the scout x  
keyword does not apply.
