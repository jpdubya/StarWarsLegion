[[Vertical Cohesion]]

Troopers occasionally find it advantageous to climb into a  
better firing position. To do so, they must engage in vertical  
movement. Vertical movement does not employ the movement  
tools. Instead, if a trooper unit leader is in base contact with a  
piece of impassable terrain, it may [[Climb]] or [[Clamber]].  

To climb, a unit must spend two move actions to safely move  
vertically up or down a distance of up to height 1 (a single  
segment of the range ruler)—but only if there is a flat surface to  
place the unit leader on at the end of this movement and if the  
unit can maintain cohesion.  

At the end of this move, the unit leader is placed on the  
flat surface at the top (or bottom, if climbing down) of the  
impassable structure, as close to the edge as possible, and  
the other minis in the unit are placed in cohesion. To be in  
cohesion, each mini in the unit must be placed no further away  
from the unit leader than the length of the speed-1 movement  
tool (for additional rules for placing miniatures in cohesion  
involving terrain, see “Cohesion” on [[page 24]]). Finally, each  
mini in the unit must also be within height 1 of the unit leader,  
measured from base to base.  

When a unit climbs, anything higher than height 1 from the  
unit leader’s position is simply too extensive a climb to commit  
to within the span of a single activation

However, a hasty clamber is sometimes worth the risks. Units  
can clamber, moving up or down a distance of up to height 1, by  
performing a single move action, but it is risky—the unit must  
roll 1 white defense die for each of its minis and suffer 1 wound  
for each block ($\Delta$) result rolled. A unit may also spend two  
move actions to move up or down in height up to height 2, but  
if it does so, it must roll two white defense dice for each mini in  
the unit and suffer one wound for each block ($\Delta$) result rolled  
(for additional rules, see “Climb and Clamber” on [[page 23]]).  

When a unit clambers to move up or down ladders, steps, or  
carved footholds, it does not roll dice or suffer wounds. Players  
should define these areas of the battlefield in Step 2 of setup.
