Climbing and clambering are types of movement that allow a  
unit to move vertically onto or over a piece of elevated terrain.  
While clambering, a unit might suffer damage.  


• If a trooper unit leader is in base contact with a piece of  
vertical terrain, it may **climb**.  

» To climb, if there is a flat surface to place the unit  
leader on at the end of this movement and the unit can  
maintain cohesion, a unit can spend two actions to safely  
move vertically up or down a distance up to height 1. At  
the end of this move, the unit leader is placed on the flat  
surface at the top or bottom of the vertical structure, as  
close to the edge as possible.  


• If a trooper unit leader is in base contact with a piece of  
vertical terrain, it may **clamber**.  
[[#Clamber]]



• If a trooper unit leader is in base contact with a piece of  
vertical terrain **without** a flat surface on top to place the unit  
leader onto, such as a fence or a thin wall, it may clamber  
up and over that terrain, ending its movement on the other  
side, provided that the terrain is height 1 or lower.

» To clamber over a vertical piece of terrain without a flat  
surface on top, a unit can spend **two** actions to move  
over the terrain. At the end of this move, the unit leader  
is placed on a flat surface at the bottom of the other  
side of the vertical structure, as close to the structure  
as possible.  

» After a unit clambers in this way, roll two white defense  
dice for each mini in the unit. For each block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) result,  
the unit suffers one wound.  


• After the unit leader climbs or clambers, each other mini is  
placed in cohesion with that leader as normal.  

» Minis in the same unit can be placed on different vertical  
levels, but each mini must be within height 1 of its  
unit leader.  


• When measuring cohesion between two minis that are  
placed on different vertical levels, a player should measure  
from the unit leader to each mini using the speed-1  
movement template, measuring from a view above the  
battlefield as if the two minis are on the same vertical level.
[[#Cohesion]]



• A unit does not have to climb or clamber to move over or  
onto terrain that has a height that is equal to or less than the  
height of its unit leader’s mini.

_For example, a Stormtrooper unit can move over a barricade  
by performing a standard move. However, the unit will  
reduce its maximum speed by one because the barricade is  
difficult terrain for trooper units._  


• A unit does not have to climb or clamber to move up a  
gradual slope such as a hill. As a general rule, if a miniature  
can be placed on a slope without falling over, units can move  
up that slope by performing a standard move. Players should  
clearly define terrain during setup.  


• When a unit climbs or clambers, the bases of the minis in  
the unit can partially overhang ledges, as long as each mini  
is stable and is not precariously placed. If there is not room  
to place a unit leader’s base on the surface that the unit is  
climbing or clambering onto, or if any mini’s base cannot  
be placed legally and maintain cohesion, that unit cannot  
perform that climb or clamber action.  


• Vehicles cannot climb or clamber with one exception. A  
vehicle that has the **climbing vehicle** keyword is treated as  
a trooper for the purposes of vertical movement.  


• When a mini with a notched base climbs or clambers, its  
base must be oriented in the exact same direction as it was  
before it climbed or clambered.


• If a game effect triggers by a unit moving, that game effect  
can be triggered by climbing or clambering.  


# Clamber
» To clamber, if there is a flat surface to place the unit  
leader on at the end of this movement and the unit can  
maintain cohesion, a unit can spend one action to move  
vertically up or down a distance up to height 1, or two  
actions to move up or down up to height 2. At the end of  
this move, the unit leader is placed on the flat surface at  
the top or bottom of the vertical structure, as close to the  
edge as possible.

» After a unit clambers, roll one white defense die for each  
mini in the unit if the unit moved up to height 1, or two  
white defense dice if the unit moved up to height 2. For  
each block (![[BlockIcon.png]]) result, the unit suffers one wound.  
- This roll is made after moving the unit leader but  
before placing the other minis in cohesion.  
- These wounds must be assigned to non-unit leader  
miniatures first.  

» A unit that has the **expert climber** keyword does not  
have to roll these dice and cannot suffer damage because  
of clambering.  

» Ladders, steps, or carved footholds aid vertical  
movement significantly. When a unit clambers to move  
up or down such an apparatus, it does not roll dice or  
suffer wounds. These features should be clearly defined  
during setup.  

# Cohesion
» When separated by vertical distances, the position of a  
mini from the position of their unit leader must also be  
within the distance of a legal climb move. If a unit leader  
is on top of elevated terrain, any minis in that unit that  
are below their unit leader must be in base contact with  
that terrain such that moving between the position of the  
leader and the position of any mini in the unit is a legal  
climb move.  

- For the distance between a mini’s position and its  
unit leader’s position to be a legal climb move, it  
must be height 1 or lower.  

» After climbing or clambering, the unit leader will by  
default be on the edge of the terrain closest to the point  
with which it was in base contact before climbing or  
clambering. Minis not placed on the same edge of the  
terrain as the leader must be placed in base contact with  
the terrain and as close as possible to this point.

» When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed  
higher than the level to which the unit leader climbed  
or clambered, or lower than the level to which the  
unit leader climbed or clambered if the unit leader  
moved downwards.

» When placing a mini in cohesion, it cannot be placed  
onto a **different** level of terrain than its unit leader,  
unless that mini’s unit leader has just climbed or  
clambered. Minis can always be placed onto the same  
level as their unit leader when being placed in cohesion.
